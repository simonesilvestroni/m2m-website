## The story

**Summer 1986**. As a teenager, I learnt how my grandfather was captured by fascists in 1941 and sent to Germany. After four years in a concentration camp on the outskirts of Berlin, he escaped, days before the Allies stormed in. After crossing Europe, he came back home.

I grew up during the **Cold War**, obsessed by a feeling of impending doom. In 1991, I took my first trip to Berlin and watched a divided city as it still was. Years passed, I went again to Berlin, yet didn’t dare to visit the camp.

2017\. I’m on the S-Bahn train to Oranienburg, this time to finally see the _konzentrationslager_. I think about the connection between my grandfather’s experience and the menacing fragile world that died on the **9th of November 1989**. When I finally cross the steel gate of [Sachsenhausen](https://www.sachsenhausen-sbg.de/en/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I realize how the story is about being a prisoner. Whether in a concentration camp, behind a wall, caught within propaganda or fearing a nuclear holocaust.

## Reviews

> Minutes to Midnight’s album is magical and haunting, giving the listener a way to both experience and reconcile the horrors and joys of the past. A journey of choices and consequences, a path of emotional growth. It is at once rock opera, gothic melancholy, family legend, and historical account, all blending together to create an album unlike any other.
> <cite>— [**Rosa Nadine Sanchéz Xochimilco**](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/after-1989-a-trip-to-freedom/after-1989-in-depth-review/), author</cite>

> The project is very impressive both in conception and execution. I love the way you’ve chosen to tell the story, the visuals, and the juxtaposition of the two Berlin experiences. It definitely reminds me a bit of Pink Floyd—both in the scope of the concept album but also the blues-influence that runs through the music and informs the whole thing stylistically. Congratulations on creating a work that tackles an immense subject and brings a great deal of emotional depth and insight into it.

> The direct and immersive narrative allows history to speak for itself without being preachy or forced. The artist gives us a unique perspective of an outsider who manages to observe a great deal of pain without being directly subjected to it. Its themes are timely and human, and effortlessly connect with a modern audience. _After 1989_ is an immersive and interesting experiment in storytelling that will leave listeners meditating on its heavy themes.
