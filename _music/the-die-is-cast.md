## Backstory

In 2018, together with Dan Ecclestone, songwriter for Cambridge-based band Ember Rev, I worked as a co-producer and mixer for their second album, [*Premonition And Ruin*]({{ site.url }}/work/music-production/premonition-and-ruin/). A song didn’t make the cut: *Land Of Kings* is my interpretation of it. Together with *Papillon*, they reference the painful process of living in England through Brexit.

I had been living in the UK for five years when the referendum took place. That night I was up in front of the TV, watching my idea of the UK — England in particular — **crumble before my eyes**.

At five in the morning, right after **the BBC declared the result**, I stood alone in the garden. It was sunny, a good fresh smell in the air. Gobsmacked and incapable of thinking clearly, I felt betrayed.

Then, the most pantomimic four years came and went, and all I could see is ‘Rule Britannia’, which looked so out of touch with the world at large. [My wife and I left the UK]({{ site.url }}/blog/back-to-the-future-leaving-the-uk/), and our good friends there, last September. I haven’t yet come to terms with the seismic change.

These two songs, even if written by someone else, prefectly encapsulate those days in June 2016. I spoke with [Gerald Duchene](https://antiquity-music.com/), long-time collaborator and friend of mine, about the idea of working together at these remixes. We both love a challenge, so off we went.

> When I first heard the original recordings of these songs, I knew there was something there. Simone and I were pretty much simpatico and on the same page right from the start of our work on these tunes. We’ve been working together for awhile now and it seems like we have comfortably fallen into this new sound. I’m very proud of the work we did on these two great songs by Dan. I think they are the products of careful thoughtful musicianship.

## Production notes

_Papillon_ started with Gerald. He sent the full **Logic Pro X project**, which featured a few instruments I didn't anticipate. The flugelhorn in particular caught me off-guard: it fit the sound so well that when I produced _Land of Kings_ I specifically asked Gerald to write another solo with it.

I produced both songs using REAPER, as I had [recently switched from Pro Tools]({{ site.url }}/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/). With _Papillon_ I worked intensively for a full day, adding the **fretless bass**, editing the drums and enhancing the rhythm with some drum doubling and a new groove using a custom patch on REAPER, where I summed my trusted **XLN Addictive Drums** to **Steven Slate Drums 5**. I wrote a piano theme, refactored all the vocals effect following the same reverb I did use in the original version, and optimized all Gerald's parts.

For _Land of Kings_ I started with the **Warwick** bass. I replaced all the original harmonium parts with a few synths, one of which is **Logic's Alchemy**, and used the bass to build a delay-driven arpeggio who pretty much served as a leading melody. For both songs, I employed my REAPER presets — which replicate the same patches I've had for years in Logic and then Pro Tools — including **send effects** (verbs, delays) and my interpretation of Michael Brauer's **multi-bus compression**.

### Vocals

I treated all the vocal tracks with my go-to set of multiple tracks running **parallel compression**. LA-2A, a Vari-Mu (I'm currently using a premium Klanghelm plugin), an 1176 and a Fairchild.

### Sound effects

A couple of samples, a classic in my original productions, completed the remixes. _Land Of Kings_ features the exact TV announcement that I witnessed at sunup on the day of the referendum (see video above). _Papillon_ references a well-known section of the [maiden speech by Jo Cox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3OQRnJ1zrQ) — murdered by a far-right extremist a few days before the referendum — at the House of Commons.
