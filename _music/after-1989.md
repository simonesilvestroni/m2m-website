## The concept

Three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the autobiographical tale of how my grandfather escaped a concentration camp in 1945, while I made the other way round, looking for answers that I could only find in 2017.

## Production

After completing the [demos]({{ site.url }}/work/music/after-1989-demos/), my friend and music partner [Paolo Clementi](https://www.discogs.com/artist/2390759-Paolo-Clementi-2) left the project in mid 2017. I'd decided to take some time and focus on graduating as a master engineer at Berklee, before spending most of 2018 working as a mix engineer and producer for clients in the UK and the US.

Alone with a project I've been working on for a long time and the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall approaching, I pushed towards revising the concept. A new synopsis with a simpler set of songs was drafted, while putting a new group of collaborators together.

The renewed project revolved around the same story but _changed the perspective_. No third-person narration, no theatrical persona. Since my grandfather and his traumatic experience in a concentration camp in Germany was the inspiration, _I became the narrator_. 

While researching through war archives in two nations, official letters and family tales, the quest to unfurl his story connected with my youth during the Cold War.

### Band line-up

To better convey the storyline, my first decision was to have songs instead of instrumentals. Since [Rachel Goodman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGztQW1g4fPy1Bz1nmiIpJw) couldn't be available for a full album, finding a lead singer was paramount. After meeting [Dan Ecclestone]({{ site.url }}/work/music-production/premonition-and-ruin/) in Cambridge, we agreed on working together.

I then involved [Gerald Duchene]({{ site.url}}/blog/tag/gerald-duchene/) to help with guitars and saxophone, [Andy Bonnor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-eZGjyZv67Xn-qvBNOmfyA) on drums and [Callum Gardner]({{ site.url}}/blog/tag/callum-gardner/) on acoustic guitar and backing vocals.

A good amount of Paolo's contributions survived, including a few arrangements, two guitar solos and his beautiful viola.

### Tracklist

The songs followed a _liaison_ between my grandfather's escape from Berlin and me going back to the same place decades later, to see his prison in person. I wanted to represent the narration as a train trip to the concentration camp where each station, as announced by the tannoy system, was a different point in history.

The album shrinked from 16 pieces to 10 songs. By axing redundant intros and all the instrumentals that didn't fit the vision, the running time went from 50 minutes to 32.

### Workflow

In between the two stages of _After 1989_, I went back to Logic Pro. Importing all the tracks into Logic sessions allowed new arrangements to accommodate the lyrics I was writing. All in all, I had come up with a complete new demo in a relatively short time.

### Collaboration

While Dan and I were both in Cambridge and Callum lived in nearby London, any work with other collaborators happened remotely. As a Logic user himself, working with Gerald was straightforward. Everyone else had to render their tracks using the correct formats and hand them over. I basically applied the same process when I had to import my own audio and MIDI tracks from the Reason demos.

_After 1989_ was recorded in Italy, United Kingdom, United States, Finland and Germany.

### Mix and master

I employed a technique borrowed from Andrew Scheps: work on three songs at the same time. This way I could focus on the big picture, exchanging methods between different pieces as I moved along.

I also dove into [Michael Brauer's multi-bus compression technique](https://brauerizing.wordpress.com/), which I already experimented with in previous productions.

Once the mix was complete, I engaged with renowned master engineer [Ian Shepherd](https://productionadvice.co.uk/about/), co-author of the famous _Loudness penalty_ website and organizer of Dynamic Range Day, who perfected it all.

### Release

Christopher Carvalho of [Unlock Your Sound](https://unlockyoursound.com), manager for _After 1989_, massively helped with the release campaign, including on social media and music submission websites. A proper word-of-mouth was key, especially with the selling of the [limited edition CD](https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/album/after-1989-a-trip-to-freedom). I sold most copies by meeting with people and discussing the album.

## Reviews

> Minutes to Midnight’s album is magical and haunting, giving the listener a way to both experience and reconcile the horrors and joys of the past. A journey of choices and consequences, a path of emotional growth. It is at once rock opera, gothic melancholy, family legend, and historical account, all blending together to create an album unlike any other.

> The direct and immersive narrative allows history to speak for itself without being preachy or forced. The artist gives us a unique perspective of an outsider who manages to observe a great deal of pain without being directly subjected to it. Its themes are timely and human, and effortlessly connect with a modern audience. _After 1989_ is an immersive and interesting experiment in storytelling that will leave listeners meditating on its heavy themes.
