## The story

**Three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall**, _After 1989_ is the tale of how a young man escaped a concentration camp in 1945, while his grandson made the other way round, looking for answers that he could only find in 2017.

## Production notes

Mid 2017: after I [completed the demos](/work/sound-design/after-1989-demos/) using Propellerhead's Reason, my friend and music partner Paolo left the project. I decided to take some time and focus on graduating as a **master engineer at Berklee**. I then spent most of 2018 working as a mix engineer and producer for clients in the UK and the US, including [performing in a dozen of live concerts](/blog/live-shows/) around the south of England.

At the end of the year, as the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall was approaching, I found myself alone with a project I've been working on for a long time. Surprisingly, this gave me a decisive push towards **revising the whole concept**. Even before Paolo left, I'd been unhappy about the creative direction for a while, so at the start of 2019 I drafted a new synopsis with a simpler set of songs and started putting together a new group of collaborators.

The renewed project touched the same story but **changed the perspective**. No third-person narration, no _theatrical persona_. Since the inspiration was my grandfather and his traumatic experience in a concentration camp in Germany, _I became the narrator_. After a steady research through war archives, official letters, family tales and a quest to find out where he spent those four years, I connected my **young years spent during the Cold War** to his not-so-distant wartime.

### New band

To efficiently convey the new storyline, my first decision was to abandon the idea of an instrumental album. I wanted songs, as in _music and lyrics_, therefore finding a lead singer was paramount. Since **Rachel Goodman** couldn't be available for a full album, I [met Dan Ecclestone](/blog/ember-rev-premonition-and-ruin/) in Cambridge and agreed on working together on our respective albums. I then involved **Gerald Duchene** to help with guitars and saxophone, **Andy Bonnor** on drums and **Callum Gardner** on acoustic guitar and backing vocals.

Even though I initially considered scraping Paolo's contributions, I ended up keeping his amazing work on half of the songs, including several of his arrangements, a few guitar solos and his **beautiful viola**.

### Tracklist

The songs followed this new idea of a _liaison_ between my grandfather's escape from Berlin and me going back to the same place decades later, **to see his prison**. I thought about representing the narration as a train trip to the concentration camp where each station, as announced by the tannoy system, was a different point in history.

The album **shrinked from 16 pieces to 10 songs**. By axing redundant intros and all the instrumentals that I didn't write or didn't fit into my vision of the story, I managed to reduce the running time from `49` minutes to `32`. I also penned the closing track _Sachsenhausen_.

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/after-1989-new-synopsis.png" caption="<em>After 1989</em>: New synopsis and tracklist" width="1013" height="570" %}

### Workflow

In between the two stages of _After 1989_, I **went back to Logic Pro**. Exported all the tracks with and without Reason's native processing, imported into Logic projects, rearranged sections, edited MIDI parts and wrote the lyrics. I then sung all the test vocals, played piano, rewrote previous ideas and morphed them into new songs. The peculiar and [complicated story of the leading single](/blog/skinny-kid-song-backstory/), _Skinny Kid_, is emblematic of this stage.

All in all I had come up with **a complete new demo** in a relatively short time.

### Collaboration

While Dan and I were both in Cambridge and Callum lived in nearby London, working with other collaborators wasn't difficult either. These days it's easy to master a <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr> and use a shared cloud disk space. Gerald is a Logic Pro user so working with him was substantially straightforward. Everyone else had to **render their stems** using the correct formats and hand them over. I basically applied the same process when I had to import my own audio and MIDI tracks from the Reason demos.

Overall, _After 1989_ was recorded in Ravenna and Milan (**Italy**), London and Cambridge (**UK**), Aiken and New York (**United States**), Mikkeli (**Finland**), Berlin (**Germany**).

### Mix and master

The next phase was edit, polish and mix. I employed a technique borrowed from **Andrew Scheps**: work on three songs at the same time. This way I could focus on the big picture, exchanging methods between different pieces as I moved along.

I also eagerly dived more deeply into [Michael Brauer's multi-bus compression](https://brauerizing.wordpress.com/) technique, which I already experimented with in previous productions. More powerful and even better refined, today it's still a staple in my templates.

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/multi-bus-brauer.png" caption="My current multi-bus tracks in REAPER" width="420" height="687" %}

In a nutshell: instead of applying a single mix bus compressor, the multi-bus methodology requires sending different instruments, **grouped by function and frequency range**, to four different set of compressors. I route piano and other synths to bus A, drums and bass to bus B, guitars, certain strings and synths to bus C, sound effects plus reverbs and delays to bus D. This way, the compressors act on specific settings without squashing material that they're not suited for. A thorough [calibration](https://youtu.be/M0akUKhkok0) is required before starting to apply any routing.

Once the mix was complete, I engaged with renowned master engineer **Ian Shepherd** (co-author of the famous _Loudness penalty_ website and organizer of Dynamic Range Day), who perfected it all.

### Software used

As a long-term project, it's hard to write down an exaustive list of all the software used by myself and my collaborators.

Fun fact: the very first version of the song _The Logic_ was written in Italian in 1995, using **Cubasis Pro v1.0 and a QY20 by Yamaha**.

### Release

**Christopher Carvalho** of Unlock Your Sound, manager for _After 1989_, massively helped with the release campaign, including on social media and music submission websites. A proper word-of-mouth was key, especially with the selling of the [limited edition CD](https://music.minutestomidnight.co.uk/album/after-1989-a-trip-to-freedom). I sold most copies by meeting with people and discussing the album.

At the time, I chose **CD Baby** for digital distribution. As a member of PRS and PPL in the UK, I also went to CD Baby for publishing rights.

## Reviews

> Minutes to Midnightâ€™s album is magical and haunting, giving the listener a way to both experience and reconcile the horrors and joys of the past. A journey of choices and consequences, a path of emotional growth. It is at once rock opera, gothic melancholy, family legend, and historical account, all blending together to create an album unlike any other.
> <cite>â€” [Rosa Nadine SanchÃ©z Xochimilco](/work/sound-design/after-1989-reviews/), author</cite>

> The direct and immersive narrative allows history to speak for itself without being preachy or forced. The artist gives us a unique perspective of an outsider who manages to observe a great deal of pain without being directly subjected to it. Its themes are timely and human, and effortlessly connect with a modern audience. _After 1989_ is an immersive and interesting experiment in storytelling that will leave listeners meditating on its heavy themes.
