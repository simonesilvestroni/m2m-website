<h4 class="text-uppercase">About Amuse</h4>

Founded in 2015, Amuse is dedicated to producing and distributing **kids' content across digital platforms**. 

> Located in the heart of Paris, our team of artists & animators, writers, developers and executives collaborate everyday to produce & distribute great shows throughout the world.

## Initial test

HR contacted me through [SoundLister](https://soundlister.com/portfolio/simone-silvestroni/), explaining the type of job and the fact it would be fully remote. They also sent a 36-seconds long test to be completed for the following week — which I did, successfully.

## Onboarding

Straightforward process: sign up for an account on their own online production management platform called _Scale3_, join their Slack, read a single induction document explaining the procedure from start to delivery, along with a **set of specifications** and how to file an invoice.

## Project management

The company adopts **agile processes** based on Scale3, to ensure a steady production schedule.

The job started before the pandemic and continued during the first lockdowns in Europe. I **interacted with the project manager** using Slack. All the episodes of _Car City_ in production were listed in the system, along with features such as state of completion, deadlines and the required documentation.

## Cloud storage

I had access to a cloud storage, where a certain amount of **audio libraries** created by Amuse were available to download and use. These included all the characters voices, reusable sounds and many car-related effects. While I was bound to use their characters libraries, they let me choose whether to adopt their other SFX folders or not. I ended up using a mix of theirs and mine.

## Tasks

I chose to book tasks based on the type of story and the fun I thought I would get from their complexity. On Scale3 all the working materials were downloadable from each episode's page: the **pre-recorded voice-over** in `.wav` format, the screenplay and a description of the general requirements.

## Workflow

Once I familiarized with the screenplay and the silent video animation, my go-to actions were:

- Open my **sound design template** in Logic Pro
- Drag the video into the timeline
- Create markers with the first obvious cues, such as the reusable scenes
- Drag and precisely position audio files for the reusable scenes and the voice-overs (following the screenplay document)

Then it was a matter of following the story and create the sound design for the rest of the movie. Sometimes I kept an iPad in _sidecar mode_, so to have the video on its own.

I didn't particularly use plug-ins except for **reverb with impulse responses**, though I did rely a lot on Logic functionalities such as **item gain**, **pan**, and a whole lot of **automation**.

## Delivery & Feedback

Amuse requested the following specifications:

<p class="detached"><strong>Audio</strong></p>

- `.wav`
- Stereo
- 48kHz, 24 bits
- No dithering
- Audio files with voice over (English)
- Audio files without voice over (mute)
- True peak: `–1 dB`
- Loudness integrated target: `–16 dB LUFS` (+/-1 dB margin)
- Dynamic range: `> 9 LU`

**Video**

- `25 fps`
- HDV
- `1280*720p`

Once the mix was finalized and uploaded to Scale3, the project manager would listen to it and upload their feedback. I would receive a message on Slack, along with the possibility of having a discussion or asking for further explanations.

Once all the edits requested in the feedback were completed and a sign-off was obtained, I would proceed to master the audio  and export the video following the guidelines. The task would be **marked as complete**, usually in less than an hour.

## Payment & Release

Payments would be sent each month on the same day following the upload of an invoice on Scale3, outlining all the signed-off tasks within that timeframe.

The release of episodes on YouTube had a schedule that was outside my scope, but were never too far away: usually a couple of weeks after my delivery.
