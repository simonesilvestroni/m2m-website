## Remote work

The job started right before the pandemic and went on during the lockdowns in Europe. I interacted with the company through their **project management system called Scale3**. All the future episodes of _Car City_ were listed in the system, along with features such as state of completion, deadlines, what was needed, the required documentation.

1. Audio guidelines
2. Production notes
3. Delivery
3. Feedback
4. Payment & Release
