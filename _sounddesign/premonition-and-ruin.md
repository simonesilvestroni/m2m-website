## Backstory

I met Ember Rev's singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Dan Ecclestone in Cambridge through [Ian Shepherd](https://productionadvice.co.uk/), a friend of his. I was looking for a singer and liked his Bowie-esque timbre and approach to vocals.

We discussed our upcoming projects over a beer and agreed on a reciprocal collaboration. He pitched his band's next project as substantially more rock than their first album. Ian was on board as a **master engineer**.

Subtitled “a remainer’s lament for the European ideal”, _Premonition and Ruin_ is an exceptional album, filled with original songs, beautifully written and arranged. Furthermore, I was excited about working with the **accordion**. It doesn’t happen often, and I love the instrument.

## Production notes

### Mix

When I started mixing the first song, _England’s Finest Hour_, I thought right away of spicing the accordion up, in a &ldquo;Gotan Project&rdquo; sort of style. I worked on the sound and the flow of the delay effect, ending up adding a strange electronic feel to the instrument. Logic’s automation allowed me to achieve a nice fluctuating movement.

For the first time, I've used my version of [Michael Brauer's multi-bus compression](https://brauerizing.wordpress.com/). Dan enjoyed my creative approach to mixing to the point of giving me **credits as a co-producer**.

### Workflow

I **added the project to my Trello boards** and added Dan as a contributor. We both followed the [plan in real time](/work/project-management/) interacting through comments, links and suggestions. We met at least once a week, and the workflow went on in the smoothest possible way. Ian started his involvement with that same first song, using a mix I exported to Dropbox. I used his advice to sort a few EQ problems from the first mix iteration.

## Follow-ups

A year later, I ended up producing the band’s follow-up album [_From The Country To The City To The Sea_](https://emberrev.bandcamp.com/album/from-the-country-to-the-city-to-the-sea-2), as well as Dan’s debut solo album [_Hidden Music_](/blog/hidden-music-dan-ecclestone/) in January 2021.

## Review

> Simone mixed my band’s latest two albums. I worked closely with him during this process, using his Trello-based methodology to help sequence the work. Each song appeared as a series of tasks to be completed, checked and commented on. As a result, we were able to manage our time smoothly and efficiently. Creative ideas flowed back and forth. I’m looking forward to involving him in the next recordings!
