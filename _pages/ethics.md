## Privacy

I don't collect personal data, don't run analytics software, ads, affiliate links or tracking. [Unless you tell me](/contact/), there is no way for me to know you've been here.

A full [content security policy ↗](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/content-security-policy/) have been implemented.

## Design

I subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_ by David Bryant Copeland.

> A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.<cite>—&nbsp;[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)</cite>

In line with a minimalist approach, [fighting against bloatware](/colophon/) means that this website keeps resources at the bare minimum. It doesn't weigh on broadband and electricity with useless scripts, tracking, ads or pointless stock photos.

## Website architecture

By adopting an <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr> as the dynamic engine to build a static website, I pursue [fighting webwaste](https://silviamaggidesign.com/design-digested/biased-ai/#webwaste). The impressive reduction in size, compared to the previous version, is `724 MB`.

## Decentralization

Part of [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), the website is capable of sending and receiving [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), a quasi-web standard for replying, liking and reposting other people’s posts on their websites.

## Small web

> Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and ‘convert’. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.<cite>—&nbsp;Parimal Satyal</cite>

I used to be on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit. That's gone, since 2020. I'm only on Mastodon and [Airwiggles](https://www.airwiggles.com) now.

## Tools

After stopping being attached to a particular brand, becoming _system agnostic_ has become second nature.

Pretty much all the software I use, with rare exceptions, can be installed and run from any operating system.

I don't use illegal software.

## Subscriptions and walled gardens

A software business model based on a subscription doesn't get attention from me. Similarly, I don't subscribe to an _ecosystem_. Albeit slightly less convenient, it gives me considerable freedom.

I'm more than happy to support <abbr title="Free and Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> projects and brilliant companies such as [Cockos Incorporated](https://cockos.com/), makers of _Reaper_, and [Sublime HQ Pty Ltd](https://www.sublimehq.com/), makers of _Sublime Text_: small but solid entities that can move swiftly when needed, with a well-thought model that doesn’t rip off customers.

None of them have a marketing department shoving ads everywhere.

## Updates

I'm opposed to updates _for the sake of it_. It means that I only follow security updates, bug fixes and actual new useful features.

At the same time, I stopped caring for any arbitrary yearly cycle of forced upgrades. If it's part of a _planned obsolescence_ strategy, it can stay out.

## Newsletter

If you subscribe to my newsletter, I will collect your email address, which will be safely stored. It will be used solely to send you emails. I do not share it with third parties. You can unsubscribe at any moment via the link in any newsletter.
