## Privacy

The website doesn’t collect personal data, it doesn’t run analytics software, it doesn’t have ads, affiliate links or tracking. Unless you [tell me](/contact/), there is no way to know you've been here.

A full [content security policy ↗](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/content-security-policy/) have been implemented.

## Design

I fully subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_ by David Bryant Copeland.

> A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.<cite>—&nbsp;[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)</cite>

In line with a minimalist approach, fighting against bloatware means that this website keeps resources at the bare minimum. It doesn't weigh on broadband and electricity with useless scripts, tracking, ads or pointless stock photos.

## Website architecture

By adopting an <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr> as the dynamic engine to build a static website, I pursue [fighting webwaste](https://silviamaggidesign.com/design-digested/biased-ai/#webwaste). Compared to the previous version, the website has an impressive reduction of **724MB** in size.

## Decentralization

The website is part of [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), therefore it’s capable of sending and receiving [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), a quasi-web standard for replying, liking and reposting other people’s posts on their websites.

## Small web

> Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and ‘convert’. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.<cite>—&nbsp;Parimal Satyal</cite>

I used to be on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit. That's all gone now, since 2020. I'm only on Mastodon and [Airwiggles](https://www.airwiggles.com) now.

## Tools

After stopping being attached to a particular brand, becoming _system agnostic_ has become second nature.

Pretty much all the software I use, with few and rare exceptions, can be installed and run from any operating system.

I don't use illegal software.

## Subscriptions and walled gardens

Everything that is locked within a _subscription model_ doesn't get neither attention nor money from me. Similarly, I don't subscribe to any _ecosystem_. Albeit slightly less convenient, it allows freedom to move around.

The business model that interests me have brilliant examples such as [Cockos Incorporated](https://cockos.com/), makers of _Reaper_, and [Sublime HQ Pty Ltd](https://www.sublimehq.com/), makers of _Sublime Text_: small but solid entities that can move swiftly when needed, with a well-thought model that doesn’t rip off customers.

I'm more than happy to support by buying and upgrading their products, because I'll be listened to. None of them have a marketing department shoving ads anywhere.

## Updates

I'm opposed to updates _for the sake of it_. It means that I only follow security updates, bug fixes and actual new useful features.

At the same time, I stopped caring for all Apple updates ever since they had chosen an insane and arbitrary yearly cycle of forced OS “upgrades”. That's part of their _planned obsolescence_ and therefore can stay out.

## Newsletter

If you subscribe to my newsletter, I will collect your email address, which will be safely stored. It will be used solely to send you emails. I do not share it with third parties. You can unsubscribe at any moment via the link in any newsletter.
