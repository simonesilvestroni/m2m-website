Having started as a bassist, I made a career out of each passion. Being able to competently juggle between different disciplines created a constant flow of curiosity and improvement.

I try to listen to people and be open to new ideas. Disliking a society that's oblivious of its unsustainability, I wrote a personal [manifesto of some of the principles I live by](/personal-manifesto/).
