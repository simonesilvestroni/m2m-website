Having started as a bassist, I made a career out of each passion. Being able to competently juggle between different disciplines created a constant flow of curiosity and improvement. I'm now hyper-focused on sound design.

I try to listen to people and be open to new ideas. Disliking a society that's oblivious of its unsustainability, I wrote a personal [manifesto of some of the principles I live by](/personal-manifesto/).

## Quick facts

{: .list-hr }
- First name is pronounced `see-mow-nay`.

- My favourite bass player is Andy Rourke.
- The moniker _Minutes to Midnight_ [does not come from Iron Maiden]({{ site.url }}/about/name-and-logo/).
