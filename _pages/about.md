## Why audio and web?

I've always been interested in **technical and creative fields** at the same time. While I've been a musician for longer, my first paid job was proofreader and then editor. It gradually morphed into web design in the late 1990s. When I joined [Playstos Entertainment](/work/sound-design/console-game-ruff-trigger/) I managed to do both web and sound design for their console video game.

## Skills

Besides being a professional bassist, I'm an expert in recording, mixing and producing music, as well as crafting websites from scratch or using a CMS. The tools I'm currently digging the most are [REAPER](http://reaper.fm/) (audio), [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) (web). Regarding hardware and software equipment, the [what I use](/uses/) page explains it all.

Both in sound and web design, I'm passionate about **minimalism and optimization**. Constantly looking for a way to complete a task in less and more efficient steps, I ended up writing an ebook about [project management](/work/project-management/) for musicians.

## Other interests

I'm an avid reader, constantly eager to know the latest about the audio and tech industries. I've always loved to lose myself in history essays and dystopian novels. Trivia: I have a longstanding ~~obsession~~ passion for typography.

## Name and logo

Before releasing the theatrical concept [_After 1989_](/work/original-music-productions/after-1989/), I wanted to establish a **connection between work activity and personal history**. It was the foundation for Minutes to Midnight’s name and logo: a tie with an unstable and risky world on the brink of war.

The expression _Minutes to midnight_ is a reference to the [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The logo is derivative of the radiation symbol combined with the glyph used in fallout shelter signs.
