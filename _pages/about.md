A graduated musician, sound designer and producer, in 2017 I founded Minutes to Midnight in Cambridge (UK). Besides releasing original music, I've been working as a sound designer, bass player and producer, from recording to the final mix.

### Beginnings

I started as a professional [bass player](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/206552-simone-silvestroni){:target="_blank"} both in the studio and live after graduating at the CPM music institute in Milan. Following a 6-year stint in music studios acquiring audio skills during the 90s, I landed a [game audio designer]({{ site.url }}/work/sound-design/ruff-trigger-playstation2-game/) role in 2000. While leading the audio team, I started my first blog, journaling about working long hours on a console video game while playing *Ico* during pauses.

### Other skills

As a sound designer, I enjoy field recording and Foley and see game audio as the ultimate audio-visual narrative medium.

Apple certified for Logic Pro X, [I transitioned to Pro Tools and later REAPER](/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/).

### Collaborations

After graduating at Berklee in music production and audio mastering, I've been working with UK-based and overseas artists such as Gerald Duchene, Dan Ecclestone, Rachel Goodman, Ember Rev, Mally Harpaz (Anna Calvi), Ciara Clifford and Callum Gardner.

As a mixer, I’ve often worked with renowned master engineer [Ian Shepherd](https://productionadvice.co.uk/about/).

Constantly looking for a way to complete a task in less and more efficient steps, I wrote an ebook about [project management for musicians]({{ site.url }}/work/project-management/). 

I also have a parallel career in web design and front-end development, [carried out under my own name](https://simonesilvestroni.com).

## Name and logo

The expression _minutes to midnight_ is a reference to the [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock), while the logo is derivative of the radiation symbol combined with the glyph used in fallout shelter signs.

Before releasing the theatrical concept [_After 1989_]({{ site.url }}/work/music/after-1989/), I wanted to establish a connection between work and personal history. The foundation for Minutes to Midnight’s name and logo is a tie with the unstable and risky world I grew up in during the Cold War.
