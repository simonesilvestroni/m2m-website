## Why audio and web?

I've always been into **technical and creative fields** at the same time. While I've been a musician for longer, my first paid job was proofreader and then editor. It gradually morphed into web design in the late 1990s. When I joined [Playstos Entertainment](/work/sound-design/console-game-ruff-trigger/) I managed to do both web and sound design during the production of a console video game, juggling between the two ever since.

## Audio skills

Besides being a professional bassist, I'm an expert in music production, especially mixing. After decades with **Logic Pro** and **Sound Forge**, the tools I'm currently digging the most are [REAPER](http://reaper.fm/) and [iZotope RX](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/rx.html). After deciding to go back to game audio, I'm deeply involved in learning Audiokinetic's [Wwise](https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise/).

## Web skills

Started crafting websites from scratch with HTML, CSS and a little Javascript. I adopted **WordPress** as my platform of choice since version 1.5, becoming an expert with its PHP structure, building custom themes and plug-ins. I recently moved to [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) and static site generators with headless CMS, especially digging **Jekyll** with its [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and **Netlify**.

## Passions

Both in sound and web design, I'm passionate about **minimalism and optimization**. Constantly looking for a way to complete a task in less and more efficient steps, I ended up writing an ebook about [project management](/work/project-management/) for musicians.  Regarding hardware and software equipment, the [what I use](/uses/) page explains it all.

## Other interests

I'm an avid reader, constantly eager to know the latest about the audio and tech industries. I've always loved to lose myself in history essays and dystopian novels. Trivia: I have a longstanding ~~obsession~~ passion for typography.

## Name and logo

Before releasing the theatrical concept [_After 1989_](/work/sound-design/after-1989/), I wanted to establish a **connection between work activity and personal history**. It was the foundation for Minutes to Midnightâ€™s name and logo: a tie with the unstable and risky world I grew up in during the Cold War.

The expression _Minutes to midnight_ is a reference to the [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The logo is derivative of the radiation symbol combined with the glyph used in fallout shelter signs.

## Website

All the details about this website are in the [case study](/work/web-design/minutes-to-midnight/) and the [Colophon](/colophon/).
