Unlike the proverbial _jack of all trades_, I truly embrace my eclectic career, and love how it made me fluent in different fields. Being able to competently juggle between print design, web development and audio production, created a constant flow of curiosity and cross-disciplinary interests.

I try to listen to people and be open to new ideas. Disliking a society that's oblivious of its unsustainability, I wrote a personal [manifesto of some of the principles I live by](/personal-manifesto/).

## Places

Born and raised in Ravenna (Italy), I became adult in Milan, where I lived and worked for 16 years. Moved to the UK in 2011, I enjoyed the process of integration with a different culture, while making a living first [as a web developer](https://simonesilvestroni.com), later as a [music producer, sound designer and musician](/work/).

## Crucial bits of formation

- Graduated at the _Berklee College of Music_ (audio mastering and music production) in 2017.
