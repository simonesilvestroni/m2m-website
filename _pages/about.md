## Being Open

Unlike the proverbial _jack of all trades_, I truly embrace my eclectic career, and love how it made me fluent in three different fields. Being able to competently juggle between design, web development and sound design, created a constant flow of curiosity and cross-disciplinary interests.

I try to listen to people and be open to new ideas. Despising a society that's oblivious of its unsustainability, I wrote a personal [manifesto of some of the principles I live by](/personal-manifesto/).

## Places

After growing up in Ravenna (Italy), my coming of age happened in Milan, where I lived and worked for 16 years. Moved to the UK in 2011, I enjoyed the process of integration with a different culture, while making a living first [as a web developer](https://simonesilvestroni.com), later as a [music producer, sound designer and musician](/work/).

## Crucial bits of formation

- Graduated (bass and music theory) at the _CPM Music Institute_ in 1995.
- Participated to the Game Developer Conference in 2002, where I witnessed to the launch of Steam by Valve and joined as a Bronze Member the [Game Audio Guild Network](/work/sound-design/ruff-trigger-playstation2-game/#game-developer-conference-and-gang) on the day of its foundation. 
- Graduated at the _Berklee College of Music_ (audio mastering and music production) in 2017.
