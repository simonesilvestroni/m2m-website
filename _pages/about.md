Playing **bass** since my teenage years, I learned the craft of **audio engineering** as a studio assistant during the Nineties. After moving to the big city, I've explored print design and development jobs as a source of income, until I was eventually hired as a [sound designer for video games](/blog/tag/sound-design/) in 1999, to me the ultimate audio-visual narrative medium. Having managed to make a career out of _each passion of mine_ means being able to competently juggle between different disciplines, which creates a constant flow of curiosity, and a desire for improvement. [My main focus is still sound]({{ site.url }}/work/).

I try to listen to people and be open to new ideas. Disagreeing with a society that's oblivious of its unsustainability, I wrote a personal [manifesto of some of the principles I live by](/personal-manifesto/).
