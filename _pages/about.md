## Why audio and web?

I've always been interested in **technical and creative fields** at the same time. While I've been a musician for longer, my first paid job was proofreader and then editor. It gradually morphed into web design in the late 1990s. When I joined [Playstos Entertainment](/work/sound-design/console-game-ruff-trigger/) I managed to do both web and sound design for their console video game.

## Skills

Besides being a professional bassist, I'm an expert in recording, mixing and producing music, as well as crafting websites from scratch or using a CMS. The tools I'm currently digging the most are [REAPER](http://reaper.fm/) (audio), [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) (web).

Both in sound and web design, I'm passionate about **minimalism and optimization**. Constantly looking for a way to complete a task in less and more efficient steps, I ended up writing an ebook about [project management](/work/project-management/) for musicians.

Regarding hardware and software equipment, the [what I use](/uses/) page explain it all.

## Other interests

I'm an avid reader, constantly eager to know the latest about the audio and tech industries. I've always loved to lose myself in history essays and dystopian novels.

## Name and logo

Before releasing the theatrical concept [_After 1989_](/work/original-music-productions/after-1989/), I wanted to establish a **connection between work activity and personal history**. It was the foundation for Minutes to Midnight’s name and logo: a tie with an unstable and risky world on the brink of war.

Being born in the early Seventies **in Italy**, a country at the forefront of what Churchill called the _iron curtain_, carried features like having a family who endured World War II or spending my first two decades in the undeclared conflict that went down as _Cold War_. The **fear of a looming military exchange** marked my whole upbringing, to a point when the idea of running to a _fallout shelter_ was considered normal.

The expression _Minutes to midnight_ is a reference to the [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The logo is derivative of the radiation symbol combined with the glyph used in fallout shelter signs.
