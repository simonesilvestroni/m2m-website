## About Simone Silvestroni

### Beginnings

I started as a professional [bass player](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/206552-minutes-to-midnight){:target="_blank"} both in the studio and live after graduating at the CPM music institute in Milan. Following a 6-year stint in music studios acquiring producing skills during the 90s, I landed a [game audio designer]({{ site.url }}/work/game-audio/console-game-ruff-trigger/) role in 2000. While leading the audio team, I started my first blog, journaling about working long hours on a console video game while playing *Ico* during pauses.

### Main skills

As a music producer, I can handle the process from tracking to mastering, with mixing as my preferred stage. As a sound designer, I enjoy field recording and Foley and see game audio as the ultimate audio-visual narrative medium.

Apple certified for Logic Pro X, [I transitioned to Pro Tools and later REAPER](/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/).

### Collaborations

After moving from Italy to the UK in 2011 and graduating at Berklee in music production and audio mastering, I've been working with local and overseas artists such as Gerald Duchene, Dan Ecclestone, Rachel Goodman, Ember Rev, Mally Harpaz, Ciara Clifford and Callum Gardner.

As a mixer, I’ve often worked with renowned master engineer [Ian Shepherd](https://www.productionadvice.co.uk/about/).

Constantly looking for a way to complete a task in less and more efficient steps, I wrote an ebook about [project management for musicians]({{ site.url }}/work/project-management/). 

I also have a parallel career in web design and front-end development, [carried out under my own name](https://simonesilvestroni.com).

## Name and logo

The expression _minutes to midnight_ is a reference to the [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock), while the logo is derivative of the radiation symbol combined with the glyph used in fallout shelter signs.

Before releasing the theatrical concept [_After 1989_]({{ site.url }}/work/music/after-1989/), I wanted to establish a connection between work and personal history. The foundation for Minutes to Midnight’s name and logo is a tie with the unstable and risky world I grew up in during the Cold War.
