Started at 16 as a bassist, I learned the craft of audio engineering as a studio assistant during the 1990s. After moving to the big city, I've explored design and programming jobs as a source of income, and was eventually hired as a [sound designer](/blog/tag/sound-design/) for video games, to me the ultimate audio-visual narrative medium. Having managed to make a career out of _each passion of mine_ means being able to competently juggle between different disciplines, which creates a constant flow of curiosity, and a desire for improvement. My main focus is **sound design**.
