## About Simone Silvestroni

A professional [bass player](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/206552-minutes-to-midnight){:target="_blank"}, after a 6-year stint in music studios acquiring producing skills during the 1990s, he landed a [game audio designer]({{ site.url }}/work/game-audio/console-game-ruff-trigger/) role in 2000. While leading the audio team, he started his first blog, journaling about working long hours on a console video game while playing *Ico* during pauses.

As a music producer, he can handle the process from tracking to mastering, with mixing as the preferred stage. As a sound designer, he enjoys field recording and Foley. Simone sees game audio as the ultimate audio-visual narrative medium. 

After moving to the UK he's worked with local and overseas artists such as Gerald Duchene, Rachel Goodman, Ember Rev and Callum Gardner. Constantly looking for a way to complete a task in less and more efficient steps, he wrote an ebook about [project management for musicians]({{ site.url }}/work/project-management/).

He also has a parallel career in web design and front-end development, [carried out under his own name](https://simonesilvestroni.com).

Born in Cremona (Italy), a passion for new wave, electronica and trip hop led him to learn to play guitar and synths. At 22, Emilio moved to Ravenna, where he got to work with several local bands, collaborating as multi-instrumentalist, producer and sound engineer in the studio. 

He wrote and produced with Mono:fi, Bruno Valeri, Arva Vacua and IsadoraD. As of recently, he started a new collaboration with Simone Silvestroni of Minutes to Midnight (UK), with whom he's working at the debut album.

## Name and logo

The expression _minutes to midnight_ is a reference to the [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock), while the logo is derivative of the radiation symbol combined with the glyph used in fallout shelter signs.

> Before releasing the theatrical concept [_After 1989_]({{ site.url }}/work/music/after-1989/), I wanted to establish a connection between work and personal history. The foundation for Minutes to Midnight’s name and logo is a tie with the unstable and risky world I grew up in during the Cold War.<cite>— Simone Silvestroni</cite>
