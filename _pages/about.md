I try to listen to people and be open to new ideas. Disagreeing with a society that's oblivious of its unsustainability, I wrote a personal [manifesto of some of the principles I live by](/personal-manifesto/).

Started at 16 as a bassist, later exploring design and programming jobs as a source of income. I made a career out of _each passion of mine_. Being able to competently juggle between different disciplines creates a constant flow of curiosity and improvement. My main focus is **sound design**.
