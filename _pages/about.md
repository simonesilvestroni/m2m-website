## Why Minutes to Midnight?

I didn’t leave [the company I co-founded](https://web.archive.org/web/20180314165034/http://uifarm.co.uk/) and co-directed for five years out of some form of frustration. Rather, I wanted to pursue both my passions: **music and web**. Name and logo were my first steps into establishing some brand presence.

## Cold war roots

Before releasing the theatrical concept [_After 1989_](/work/original-music-productions/after-1989/), I wanted to establish a **connection between work activity and personal history**. It was the foundation for Minutes to Midnight’s name and logo: a tie with an unstable and risky world on the brink of war.

Being born in the early Seventies **in Italy**, a country at the forefront of what Churchill called the _iron curtain_, carried features like having a family who endured World War II or spending my first two decades in the undeclared conflict that went down as _Cold War_. The **fear of a looming military exchange** marked my whole upbringing, to a point when the idea of running to a _fallout shelter_ was considered normal.

The expression _Minutes to midnight_ is a reference to the [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a symbol which have represented the likelihood of a human-made global catastrophe since the start of the atomic age. Thus, the logo is derivative of the radiation symbol combined with the glyph used in fallout shelter signs.
