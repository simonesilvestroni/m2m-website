## What I stand for

Leading a quiet life in a time where noise, toxic controversy and anger have become dominant, is a struggle. Capitalism seems to favour abject things like patriarchy, racism, sexism, homophobia, and an incessant rush to accumulate wealth at the expense of people and the environment.

I don’t contribute to this hive mind mentality, especially when fuelled by soulless corporations, and also stay away from the constant breaking news circus. I’ve expanded on these topics in [`/personal-manifesto`]({{ site.url }}/personal-manifesto/).

## What I do

While my small-town boy introversion is challenging in a raucous world, it has brilliant side effects. Helped by an eidetic memory, and the ability to hyper focus, I can dig deep into several interests, learning and honing new crafts over time. As a result, a peculiar skill of mine is the capacity to work comfortably in both creative and technical roles. 

After graduating from music school, I acquired production chops as a resident bass player and studio assistant during the 1990s. Attracted by tiny villages and metropolis alike, I moved to the big city, where I worked as a print designer and editor to fund my music activities. Seeing web design as a natural evolution of the publishing industry, I built my first website in 1997.

Shortly after, I received an invite for a job interview with a company that was looking for a web developer who could also understand design. As they were starting production on a platform video game, I [landed the double role of sound and web designer]({{ site.url }}/blog/joining-playstos/), bringing my duality to a full circle.<br><br>

## More

I care about accessibility, [sustainability]({{ site.url }}/blog/tag/sustainability/), the environment. The recent renaissance of what is now called the *small web* pushed me to [redesign my site and join the IndieWeb movement]({{ site.url }}/blog/website-minutes-to-midnight/).

As part of the process, I have a [`/now`]({{ site.url }}/now/) page where I write down the things I'm involved with at the moment, a [`/links`]({{ site.url }}/links/) page which is what years ago would have been called *blogroll*, and a [`/uses`]({{ site.url }}/uses/) page, with a list of the tools I use.
