## E-mail

I still prefer e-mail over any other form of communication.

A few years ago I’ve switched to [Protonmail](https://proton.me), after possibly using all the available systems out there — both free and paid. Even though I’m not entirely satisfied, it fits my current privacy needs.

Being a premium customer gives me full access to their secure Calendar and Drive options, which makes easy to switch off alternatives such as Apple/Google calendar and cloud drive.

My first e-mail client was [Eudora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(email_client)).

## RSS

[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is still my primary mean to read online, as it has been for a long time. After having used desktop clients for decades, I’ve recently switched to [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/). The prompt was a need to consolidate several sources and cut the middle figures. Their business model seems honest enough and the UI/UX is satisfying.

I can read newsletters there, collected within a single tag, follow my YouTube subscriptions while avoiding the website altogether. This strips their algorithm out, along with the noise of comments and whatnot. If the urge to interact comes up, it’s easy to click the link and go to the website.

There are desktop clients and mobile apps — in fact, I own [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com/), which supports Feedbin accounts. However, I seem to enjoy the web app considerably more.

Since I’m [not following mainstream news](/blog/degrowth/), the categories in Feedbin reflects my main interests:

- Personal blogs
- Science
- Music tech
- Sound design
- Video game industry
- YouTube subscriptions
- Newsletters

## YouTube

Besides following subscriptions through RSS, I tend to save important videos offline. I use [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for this.

## Read later

Ever since Reeder 5 has introduced the possibility to add a [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) account, it quickly became my preferred way to read long-form articles on desktop. Not being on the premium plan makes it impossible to keep articles if they disappear from the web, therefore I tend to consume my saved links reasonably quickly.

## Social interactions

I joined Mastodon in 2017, only to leave after a few months because I still was on Twitter and its mechanism of keeping people hooked on the platform. In 2020, I’d deleted all my social media accounts and [re-joined the Fediverse](https://indieweb.social/web/@m2m).

Another angle on the Fediverse that I joined is [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/@m2m). Promoted as a humane alternative to Instagram, is (intuitively) a photo-sharing platform. It’s quiet and relaxing, probably because it’s got a small number of subscribers.

Outside the fediverse, I follow a few onine forums, in particular [Reaper’s](https://forum.cockos.com/forumdisplay.php?f=20). My Reddit account is strictly in read-mode, subscribing to a small bunch of sound design and game audio-related groups and checking them once a week.

I started in the 1990s with BBSes and Usenet newsgroups. Still missing both.

## Personal and work websites

[Work on my website](/colophon/) is performed manually, after years on WordPress. It’s a minimalistic approach which perfectly suits the need to cut down on bloat and (digital) noise. I use Jekyll with its Liquid template language, writing posts in Markdown and deploying to Netlify. I love the process and it doesn’t cost a dime. Along with Mastodon, the blog is my way of reaching out.

I started bloggin in March 2002.

## Traditional media online

The only news outlet that I keep checking on regularly is [Legible News](https://legiblenews.com/). Like the newspapers of yore, they publish an update the day after. It’s slow, accurate, private and [doesn’t track](https://legiblenews.com/about).

If, for whatever reason, the need to read mainstream news headlines arises, I use the [text version of NPR](https://text.npr.org/). Nine times out of ten, I don’t click the links. The number of times I find myself checking the site decreases exponentially over time. Every blue moon I check [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/world/), in search for long-form analysis that can be added to my read later list.

## Chat

While I still prefer e-mail for communicating with people, I have an account on Telegram and — unfortunately — WhatsApp. The latter feels forced onto me by the fact I’m about to move abroad again, and apparently my home country is hooked on Meta.

I used IRC for a very long time. Don’t even know why I stopped, maybe the [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect).

I also maintain a [/uses page](/uses/) with an *excessively* detailed list of equipment, both hardware and software.
