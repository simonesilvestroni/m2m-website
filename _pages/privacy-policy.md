## Who I am

I am Simone Silvestroni, and this is my personal website. 
My website address is: [https://minutestomidnight.co.uk](/).

## Your personal data

The website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Go to the Jekyll website"){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which is a static web generator, and it does not collect any personal data about visitors.

### Embedded content from other websites

This site may include embedded content from other websites, such as Bandcamp, Spotify, Soundcloud, YouTube: they behave in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. They may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

An exception to the above is for **YouTube videos**, where all the embeds specifically come from `https://www.youtube-nocookie.com`.

## Security

The website adopts a secure <abbr title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</abbr> protocol and it’s hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Go to the Netlify website"){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

## Analytics

This website doesn’t use analytics, therefore it doesn’t track visits.

## Newsletter

If you subscribe to my newsletter, I will collect your email address, which will be stored by Mailchimp. It will be used solely to send you emails. I do not share it with third parties. You can unsubscribe at any moment via the link in my newsletters.
