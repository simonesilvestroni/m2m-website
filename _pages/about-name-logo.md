The expression _minutes to midnight_ is a reference to the [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock), while the logo is derivative of the radiation symbol combined with the glyph used in fallout shelter signs.

Before releasing the theatrical concept [_After 1989_]({{ site.url }}/work/music/after-1989/), I wanted to establish a connection between work and personal history. The foundation for Minutes to Midnight’s name and logo is a tie with the unstable and risky world I grew up in during the Cold War.
