Iâ€™ve been designing and coding accessible and performant websites since 1998, using HTML, CSS, PHP, WordPress, and now Jekyll. I present here a selection of relevant case studies. 

<div class="h-feed">
	{% assign devProjects = site.posts | where_exp:'post','post.tags contains "dev project"' | sort: 'date' | reverse -%}
	{%- for post in devProjects %}
	{% include pattern-casestudy.html %}
	{% endfor %}
</div>
