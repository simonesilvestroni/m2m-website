## Hardware

As I’ve been working entirely in the box for years, I don’t own neither a console nor any analog outboard.

### Workstation

I’ve been running all my activities on a maxed out 15-in **MacBook Pro** i7 Mid 2015. My plan is to switch to a self-assembled professional gaming PC, where I can keep running a Hackintosh partition along with other OSes.

I also have a **27-in Dell** HD monitor, a wireless Apple **Magic Keyboard** and a **Razer Deathadder** mouse.

### Instruments

The main bass is a **Warwick Thumb Bass** bought in March 1992. A few years ago, I’ve added a **fretless Fender Jazz** and a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. After using two amps in my career — an SWR Redhead from 1990 to 2011 and a MarkBass — I now plug the bass into a Tech 21 NYC **Sansamp Bass Driver v2**.

### Audio interface

It’s been with Focusrite for more than 10 years. Currently, my audio card of choice is the **Clarett 4Pre USB**. Instead of its integrated headphone outputs, I prefer the dedicated **FX-Audio DAC-X6**.

### Speakers and headphones

Having sold my Focal Alpha 80 before leaving the UK, I now only have a **Yamaha HS5** pair. The studio staple **Sony MDR-7506** are my workhorse. A pair of comfortable **Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro** are around, to record bass tracks and listen to music in general.

### Controllers

- **Behringer X-Touch One** control surface
- **Novation Launchkey** Mini MkII
- **Korg Micro KEY 66** MIDI keyboard

### Recorder and microphones

- **Zoom H5** field recorder
- **Zoom XY** stereo mic
- **Zoom SSH-6** mid-side stereo shotgun mic
- A couple of boompoles and tripods
- Shure **SM58** mic
- Rode **NT5** condenser matched pair mics
- Rode Stereo Bar **SB20**
- Thomann **SC 1100** studio large diaphragm mic

### eReader

I tried a Kindle in the past: sold it and never looked back. Been reading ebooks with my **Kobo Glo** for a long time. Another pro: the ability to sync with [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to keep up with articles. I keep my books organized and in sync with the Kobo using the cross-platform **Calibre**.

### Mobile device

Since I ditched the iPhone, an almost 3-year-old **Redmi Note 7 Pro** by Xiaomi is all I need. Dual SIM, I use a slot for a 256 GB mini-SD card containing my whole music library in MP3 format.

## Software

### Operating system

As a **system-agnostic** I either use macOS, Windows or Linux, depending on the task. I’m both interested in experimentation and [*opposed to updates for the sake of it*](#update-policy), therefore, I use what I think it’s the best for me. Right now it’s macOS Mojave 10.14.6 and Windows 11. I have a series of Linux live dongles: Ubuntu, Kali and a few others.

### Digital Audio Workstation

Throughout the years, I have tried almost all the DAWs out there (we used to simply call them *sequencers*), starting with the first one I owned: *Cubasis Audio*, in 1995. A long-time **Logic** user, I switched to **Pro Tools**, only to [switch again](/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/) to **Reaper**, the DAW offering the best workflow for my needs along with the greatest business model.

I sometimes run Pro Tools for compatibility, while I still use Logic and **Reason** for their synths.

### Audio editor

My first editor was *CoolEdit Pro*, which was bought by Adobe and became **Audition**. I then used **SoundForge** and Steinberg **Wavelab**. In 2017 I landed on **iZotope RX** and never looked back. I also own and have experience using **DSP-Quattro** and **Triumph**, which I use to finalize mastering tasks.

### Audio software instruments

My staples are:

- Addictive Keys and Addictive Drums by **XLN**
- Hollywood Strings Gold by **EastWest**
- Alchemy, Sculpture and EXS24 by **Apple**
- XPand! 2 by **Air**
- Vital and Helm by **Matt Tytel**
- LABS by **Spitfire**
- Sitala
- ReaSamplomatic 5000 by **Cockos**

Other software synths, in no particular order:

- Decent Sampler running the [Pianobook library](https://www.pianobook.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- Reason 8 synths
- Iris 2 by iZotope
- AAS Ultra Analog Session + Lounge Lizard
- UVI Workstation with Digital Synsation library
- Novation Bass Station
- Podolski and Tyrell by U-he
- Cherry Audio Surrealistic MG-1 Plus
- AudioThing SR-88
- IK Multimedia Syntronik Memory-V
- Waves Electric Grand 80

### Audio processing plug-ins

I only focus on a few set of good plug-ins, trying to learn them at my best.

- Waves
- Soundtoys
- iZotope Ozone Extended v9
- AudioThing
- Klanghelm
- Cockos
- McDSP compressors
- Voxengo
- Melodyne 5

### Game audio

While I used to work with proprietary tools and editors, including Microsoft’s XACT for Xbox, I now focus on Audiokinetic **Wwise** and **FMOD Studio**, and their integrations with Unreal Engine and Unity.

### Audio accessories

I employ several utilities, such as the excellent time-saver [Stereo Monoizer](https://www.soundizers.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, along with brilliant freeware like:

- [Adapter](https://macroplant.com/adapter){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [IINA player](https://iina.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [XLD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xld/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [MetaDigger](https://www.sound-ideas.com/Page/metadigger-data-management-software){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### Text editors and terminal

Same as with Digital Audio Workstations, I’ve been back and forth trying plenty of text editors on multiple operating systems. I recently went back to the cross-platform **Sublime Text**, upgrading my old license to v4, because of the reasons [explained by Nikita](https://tonsky.me/blog/sublime/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. For markdown editing, I use **iA Writer**.

I only use the **Terminal** application that comes with the system I’m using: Apple’s integrated Terminal, currently customized with [Starship](https://starship.rs/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Microsoft’s Windows Terminal and whatever console I find on Linux.

On both editor and terminal, I use a iA Writer variation of the font **IBM Plex Mono** ([Nerd Font version](https://www.nerdfonts.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}), so that my writing experience is consistent.

### Internet and communication

**Firefox** is my current main browser on all devices. **uBlock Origin** and **DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials** are my most used extensions. I also keep a clean copy of [Ungoogled Chromium](https://ungoogled-software.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on my workstation, for website testing and debug.

**Thunderbird** is the email client I’ve been using, because it’s powerful, cross-platform and syncs perfectly with *Protonmail*. On Android, I revert to Protonmail’s own app.

### Image manipulation

**Sketch** v59, **Pixelmator**, **Graphic Converter** on macOS; **Lunacy** and **Figma** on Windows.

### Office and Desktop publishing

**LibreOffice** on each system. If I need something more specific or refined, for example the sleeve design for a CD, there is [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. On macOS, **Pages**, **Numbers** and **Keynote** are often a go-to for quick solutions.

### RSS reader

I only get my news through blogs, magazines and tech feeds, using [Reeder](https://reeder.app/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on macOS only. I keep my subscriptions locally — don’t care about sharing the feeds in *the cloud* with other devices.

On Android I only read from **Pocket** and **HackerNews**, which I access through an excellent client called [Harmonic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simon.harmonichackernews&hl=en_US&gl=US){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### Task management

Having a dislike of Atlassian, I recently moved out of **Trello** in favor of [Todoist](https://todoist.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Ever since I discovered they’ve added columns, I keep the app on every device and [organize my activities](/work/project-management/) using a **GTD methodology**.

### Messaging

**Telegram**, **Signal** or plain SMS. I dislike all the video call applications out there, though I reluctantly have an account with Skype and Zoom.

### Music player

Having ditched iTunes a long time ago, I use [Swinsian](http://www.swinsian.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on macOS, which looks and behave like iTunes before Apple bloated it beyond recognition. Since I host my music library on an external drive, I also have a copy of [Winamp](https://winamp.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on Windows and [Pulse Music](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.hardcodecoder.pulsemusic/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on Android.

I’ve also downloaded everything I bought through **Bandcamp**, so that I can avoid streaming altogether.

### Video player

**IINA** on macOS, **VLC** everywhere else.

### Utilities

**Alfred** is my launcher and search tool on macOS, along with a few of its brilliant workflows. The **PowerToys** app on Windows performs a similar function. The cross-platform **Bitwarden** holds the passwords and most of my two-factor OTP. I’m also a fan of command line utilities such as `youtube-dl` for downloading videos from a multitude of online sources.

### Cloud sync

I stopped using iCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive (or whatever they call it now) long ago. I still have Dropbox for a quick file exchange with friends and clients, only using it *in the browser*. The only sync system I use is [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and the reasons come from this statement on their website:

> _Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it's transmitted over the internet_.

### Backup

**Carbon Copy Cloner** and Apple’s Time Machine on macOS, **Acronis True Image** on Windows. Following a strict [3-2-1 rule](/blog/backup-and-audio-archival/), Backblaze is my off-site backup solution. Between current projects, past archives, personal data and backups, there are around 15 terabytes of storage.

### Update policy

I mentioned above how **I’m opposed to updates for the sake of it**. It means I’m only interested in software updates because of much-needed fixes or new *actual features* that are useful, maybe because their users requested so. 

Brilliant examples come from [Cockos Incorporated](https://cockos.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (makers of Reaper) and [Sublime HQ Pty Ltd](https://www.sublimehq.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (makers of Sublime Text). It’s likely not a coincidence that both companies have three to four employees. They *actually use* what they’re selling, therefore they can understand their users. Small entities with a decent and well thought business model, that doesn’t rip off customers and can move swiftly if needed. That’s the only kind I’m interested in. I’m more than happy to pay for their products, because I know I’ll be listened to.

As another example, I **stopped caring about Logic updates** ever since Apple had decided to tie them to their insane and arbitrarily idiotic yearly cycle of forced OS “upgrades”. I’ve decided to stick to macOS Mojave, a 3+ years old system and this means I can’t have the [new Logic version](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/specs/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which requires last year’s OS as a minimum. **Planned obsolescence** brought by a multi-trillion-dollar company is not my cup of tea.
