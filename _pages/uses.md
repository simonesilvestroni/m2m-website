### Update policy

I mentioned how **I’m opposed to updates for the sake of it**. It means I only upgrade for:

1. much-needed fixes
2. security updates
3. _really new features_ that are useful, maybe because their users requested so

Brilliant examples come from [Cockos Incorporated](https://cockos.com/) (makers of Reaper) and [Sublime HQ Pty Ltd](https://www.sublimehq.com/) (makers of Sublime Text). Likely not a coincidence that both companies have very few employees.

They _actually use_ what they’re selling, therefore they understand their users. These are small entities with a decent and well-thought business model that doesn’t rip off customers and can move swiftly when needed. That’s the only kind I’m interested in. I’m more than happy to support by buying and upgrading their products, because I know I’ll be listened to.

For the same reasons I now refuse to use Avid's products and pretty much everything that is locked-in with a _subscription model_.

On the negative side, I stopped caring for Logic updates ever since Apple had decided to tie them to their insane and arbitrarily idiotic yearly cycle of forced OS “upgrades”. I’ve decided to stick to any OS that works for me, which might well be a few years old. Any [new Logic version](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/specs/) requires last year’s OS as a minimum. _Planned obsolescence_ brought by multi-trillion-dollar companies is not my cup of tea.
