## Hardware

### Workstation

Maxed out 15-in **MacBook Pro** i7 Mid 2015 later fitted with a 1 TB SSD by Samsung. I'll be using this computer until it breaks apart, after which the plan is to build a high-end professional gaming PC, where I can keep running a triple-boot Hackintosh, Windows and Linux.

A **27-in Dell** HD monitor, a wireless Apple **Magic Keyboard 2** and a **Razer Deathadder** mouse complete the current computer setup.

### Music instruments

The main bass is a **Warwick Thumb Bass** bought in March 1992. A few years ago, I’ve added a **fretless Fender Jazz** and a **Fender Stratocaster** electric guitar. Having used two amps in my career — an SWR Redhead from 1990 to 2011 and a MarkBass later — I now plug the bass into a Tech 21 NYC **Sansamp Bass Driver v2**.

### Audio interface

With Focusrite for more than ten years. Currently, my audio interface of choice is the **Clarett 4Pre USB**. Instead of its integrated headphone outputs, I prefer a dedicated **FX-Audio DAC-X6** through optical.

### Speakers and headphones

Having sold my Focal Alpha 80 before leaving the UK, I now only have a **Yamaha HS5** pair. The studio staple **Sony MDR-7506** are my workhorse. A pair of comfortable **Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro** are around, to record bass tracks and listen to music in general.

### MIDI controllers

- **Novation Launchkey** Mini MkII
- **Behringer X-Touch One** control surface
- **Korg Micro KEY 66** MIDI keyboard

### Recorder and microphones

- **Zoom H5** field recorder
- **Zoom XY** stereo mic
- **Zoom SSH-6** mid-side stereo shotgun mic
- A couple of boompoles and tripods
- Shure **SM58** mic
- Rode **NT5** condenser matched pair mics
- Rode Stereo Bar **SB20**
- Thomann **SC 1100** studio large diaphragm mic

### Mobile device

Since I ditched the iPhone, a 3-year-old **Redmi Note 7 Pro** by Xiaomi is all I need. A 256 GB mini-SD card contains my whole music library on the go.

### eReader

Been reading ebooks with my **Kobo Glo** for a long time. Another pro: the ability to sync with [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) to keep up with articles. I keep my books organized and in sync with the reader using the cross-platform [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

## Software

### Operating system(s)

I mostly do my work with macOS, though as a **system-agnostic** I can easily work with Windows or Linux, depending on the task. I’m interested in experimentation but [opposed to updates for the sake of it](#update-policy), therefore I use what I think it’s the best for me. Currently:

- **macOS** Big Sur 11.6.5
- **Windows** 10
- **Pop_OS** (by System76)

A series of Linux live dongles are available, including **Debian**, **Kali** and **Elementary**.

### Digital Audio Workstation

Throughout the years, I have tried almost all the DAWs out there, starting in a third-party studio equipped with **Notator** on the Atari up to the first I personally owned: *Cubasis Audio*, in 1995. A long-time **Logic** user, I switched to **Pro Tools**, only to [switch again](/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/) to **Reaper**, the DAW offering the best workflow for my needs along with the greatest business model. I sometimes run Logic and **Reason** for their synths.

### Audio editor

My first editor was *CoolEdit Pro*, later acquired by Adobe and renamed **Audition**. I then used **SoundForge** and Steinberg **Wavelab**. In 2017 I landed on **iZotope RX** and never looked back. **Triumph** is for finalizing mastering tasks such as DDP authoring.

### Audio software instruments

My staples are:

- Addictive Keys by **XLN**
- Addictive Drums by **XLN**
- Decent Sampler by **Decidedly**, running the [Pianobook library](https://www.pianobook.co.uk/)
- LABS by **Spitfire**
- Flow Motion FM Synth by **Waves**
- Vital by **Matt Tytel**
- Sitala by **Decomposer**
- XPand! 2 by **Air**
- Hollywood Strings Gold by **EastWest**
- ReaSamplomatic 5000 by **Cockos**

Other software synths, in no particular order:

- **Logic** synthesizers and sampler:
  + Alchemy
  + Sculpture
  + EXS24
- **Reason** 8.2.3 synthesizers and sampler:
  + Kong drum designer
  + Redrum
  + Thor
  + SubTractor
  + Malström
  + Radical piano
  + StringWERK
  + NN-XT
- Iris 2 by **iZotope**

- Surrealistic MG-1 Plus by **Cherry Audio**
- SR-88 by **AudioThing**
- Syntronik Memory-V by **IK Multimedia**
- Electric Grand 80 by **Waves**

### Audio processing plug-ins

Rather than accumulating a pointless amount of effects, I focus on a few set of quality plug-ins, trying to learn them at my best. A very few of them are free. I spend most of my time using:

- Horizon bundle, Abbey Road, SSL 4000 and API collection, plus others by **Waves**
- Soundtoys 5 by **soundtoys**
- Ozone Extended 9 by **iZotope**
- SPAN plus and Correlometer by **Voxengo**
- VUMT deluxe and MJUC variable-tube compressor by **Klanghelm**
- REAPER stock plug-ins by **Cockos**

Occasionally:

- Fog Convolver, Things collection and Valves by **AudioThing**
- Compressors collection by **McDSP**
- Melodyne 5 by **Celemony**

### Game audio

While I used to work with proprietary tools and editors, including [Microsoft’s XACT for Xbox](/work/sound-design/console-game-ruff-trigger/#xbox), I now focus on Audiokinetic's **Wwise** and Firelight's **FMOD Studio**, and their integrations with Epic's **Unreal Engine** and **Unity**.

### Audio accessories

- [Stereo Monoizer](https://www.soundizers.com/)
- [Myriad](https://www.zynaptiq.com/macaudioapps/)
- [IINA player](https://iina.io/)
- [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
- [Adapter](https://macroplant.com/adapter)
- [XLD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xld/)
- [MetaDigger](https://www.sound-ideas.com/Page/metadigger-data-management-software)

### Text editors and terminal

Same as with Digital Audio Workstations, I’ve been back and forth trying plenty of text editors on multiple operating systems. I recently went back to the cross-platform **Sublime Text**, upgrading my old license to v4, because of the reasons so well [explained by Nikita](https://tonsky.me/blog/sublime/). For pure markdown writing and preview I prefer **iA Writer** with the GitHub theme.

I only use the **Terminal** application that comes with the system I’m using. Apple’s integrated Terminal.app has a customized prompt (using bash). On both editor and terminal I set the font [SF Mono](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).

### Browser and e-mail

While a clean copy of [Brave](https://brave.com/) and Safari are used for website testing and debug, **Firefox** is my daily browser. Extensions I use: 

- uBlock Origin
- Bitwarden
- Decentraleyes
- MarkDownload
- Modern for Wikipedia
- OneTab
- Reader View

[Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/) has been my email provider for the last few years. I periodically perform a full download of my emails through their custom export tool, for backup purposes.

### Image manipulation

**Figma** on all platforms. On macOS:

- Sketch v59
- Pixelmator
- Graphic Converter
- ImageOptim

### Office and Desktop publishing

**LibreOffice** on all platforms. On macOS:

- [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/)
- Pages
- Numbers
- Keynote

### News and RSS reader

I consume news through blogs, magazines and tech feeds, mostly using [Reeder](https://reeder.app/) on macOS. Subscriptions are kept local: no feeds in the cloud. On Android I read from **Pocket** and **Hacker News**, which I access through an excellent client called [Harmonic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simon.harmonichackernews&hl=en_US&gl=US). After joining the Fediverse, I also get info from [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/web/@m2m).

### Task management

Having a dislike of Atlassian, I recently moved out of **Trello** in favor of [Todoist](https://todoist.com/). Ever since I discovered they’ve added columns, I keep the app on every device and [organize my activities](/work/project-management/) using a **GTD methodology**.

### Messaging

**Telegram**, **Signal** or plain SMS.

### Music player

Having ditched iTunes long ago, I use [Swinsian](http://www.swinsian.com) on macOS, which looks and behave like iTunes before Apple bloated it beyond recognition. I host my music library on an external drive. Everything I bought through **Bandcamp** is downloaded as well.

### Video player

The magnificent [IINA](https://iina.io/) on macOS, [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) everywhere else.

### Utilities

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is my launcher and search tool on macOS, along with a few of its brilliant workflows.
- [PowerToys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install) on Windows perform a similar function.
- The cross-platform [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) holds the passwords and most of my two-factor <abbr title="One Time Password">OTP</abbr>.
- I’m a fan of command line utilities such as [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for downloading videos from a multitude of online sources.

### Cloud sync

It's been a long time since I stopped using iCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive (or whatever they call it now). I still have a **Dropbox** account for a quick file exchange with friends and clients, _only using it in the browser_. The only sync system I use is [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), and the reasons come from this statement on their website:

> Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it's transmitted over the internet.

### Backup

- [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/) on macOS
- **Acronis True Image** on Windows
- Backblaze as an off-site backup solution, since I follow a strict [3-2-1 rule](/blog/backup-and-audio-archival/)

Between current projects, past archives, personal data and backups, there are around `15 TB` of storage.

### Update policy

I mentioned how **I’m opposed to updates for the sake of it**. It means I only upgrade for:

1. much-needed fixes
2. security updates
3. _really new features_ that are useful, maybe because their users requested so

Brilliant examples come from [Cockos Incorporated](https://cockos.com/) (makers of Reaper) and [Sublime HQ Pty Ltd](https://www.sublimehq.com/) (makers of Sublime Text). Likely not a coincidence that both companies have very few employees.

They _actually use_ what they’re selling, therefore they understand their users. These are small entities with a decent and well-thought business model that doesn’t rip off customers and can move swiftly when needed. That’s the only kind I’m interested in. I’m more than happy to support by **buying and upgrading their products**, because I know I’ll be listened to.

For the same reasons I now refuse to use Avid's products and pretty much everything that is locked-in with a _subscription model_.

**On the negative side**, I stopped caring for Logic updates ever since Apple had decided to tie them to their insane and arbitrarily idiotic yearly cycle of forced OS “upgrades”. I’ve decided to stick to any OS that works for me, which might well be a few years old. Any [new Logic version](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/specs/) requires last year’s OS as a minimum. _Planned obsolescence_ brought by multi-trillion-dollar companies is not my cup of tea.
