### Update policy

I’m opposed to updates for the sake of it. It means I only upgrade for:

- much-needed fixes
- security updates
- _really new features_, maybe because their users requested so

Brilliant examples come from [Cockos Incorporated](https://cockos.com/) (makers of Reaper) and [Sublime HQ Pty Ltd](https://www.sublimehq.com/) (makers of Sublime Text): small entities with a decent and well-thought business model that doesn’t rip off customers and can move swiftly when needed. I’m more than happy to support by buying and upgrading their products, because I know I’ll be listened to.

For the same reasons, I refuse to use Avid's products and pretty much everything that is locked-in with a _subscription model_, as well as I stopped caring for Logic updates ever since Apple had decided to tie them to their insane and arbitrarily idiotic yearly cycle of forced OS “upgrades”. **Planned obsolescence** brought by multi-trillion-dollar companies is not my cup of tea.
