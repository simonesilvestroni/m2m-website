	<h2>On the desk</h2>
	<p>On a Quik-Lok Z-250 <em>Triple Shelf Workstation</em>, a maxed out Mid-2015 <strong>MacBook Pro i7</strong> runs macOS 14.4, connected to an Apple Magic Keyboard 2, a Logitech M350 Pebble mouse, and a 27-in Dell screen. Several external drives are attached to an Anker USB hub. An <strong>Audient iD14 audio interface</strong> feeds a Yamaha HS5 pair of speakers, while a Novation Launchkey Mini MkII serves as my main MIDI controller (a Korg Micro KEY 66 and a Behringer X-Touch One are also available). I work a lot with headphones, which are the Ollo S4X, and the Sony MDR-7506.</p>

	<p>An <strong>iPhone SE (2019)</strong> running the latest iOS has my UK number, and it's my daily rider, while my 2019 <strong>Xiaomi Redmi Note 7</strong> running a custom ROM with the latest Android 13 has my Italian number, used to manage Italian bureaucracy and keep in touch with family and friends. I read ebooks on a <strong>2015 Kobo Glo</strong>.</p>
