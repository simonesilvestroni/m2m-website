description: "As a cross-disciplinary polymath, Iâ€™ve been juggling between design and audio since the early 1990s. Here is some of my work as a sound and web designer."
excerpt: 'In 1995, while interning as an editor, I graduated as a <strong>bass player</strong>. Switched a few years later from the publishing industry to <strong>web design</strong>. After spending the following decades working as a <strong>game audio designer</strong> and a front-end developer between Italy and the UK, I gained a diploma at Berklee, specializing in music production, especially <strong>mixing</strong>.'
closure: 'Since 2019, after releasing <a href="/work/original-productions/">a concept album and an EP</a>, I published a <a href="/work/project-management/">free eBook</a> on how I approach project management as a freelance in the music business.'

### Sound design

#### ðŸŽ¸ Bass

Self-taught from 1987 to 1991, I had private tuition for a couple of years before enrolling for the <strong>CPM music institute</strong> in Milan and graduating with Stefano Cerri and Nicoletta Caselli. Been playing bass ever since between Italy, the UK and with US-based acts, both <a href="/blog/live-shows/">live</a> and in the studio.

#### ðŸŽ® Game audio

In the 2000s, I was the audio team leader for the PlayStation video game _Ruff Trigger â€“ The Vanocore Conspiracy_, shipped in 2007. I was in charge of directing the **soundtrack**, creating and editing the **sound effects** while co-ordinating a team of four people: 2 sound designers and 2 audio programmers.

The following prototype teaser is a full-motion extract from a promotional video. All of the sound effects were recorded in the studio using [Foley techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_(filmmaking)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

{% include pattern-video.html id="aYFyApq7NhE" %}

Working closely with the audio programmers, I implemented an [adaptive soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_music){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} within the **in-house game engine**: MXE<sup>&copy;</sup>. What we did was deploying stems divided in adaptable chunks. Similarly to what can be achieved today with **audio middleware**, the layers could be triggered by specific parameters, based on different situations in the _gameplay_.

More recently, Iâ€™ve been working as a sound designer for the **3D cartoon** series [Car City InvenTom](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkoLs_TGaHRP8DM4YXps6qQ){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, created by Paris-based Amuse Animation.

#### ðŸŽ§ Production

Iâ€™ve been producing music since the 1990s, but only properly focused on it over the last decade. Specialized in mixing, I strive to respect the brief from the artist, add my creativity when requested, and deliver on time, involving clients in my real-time process.

I produced albums and singles in **the UK, the United States and Italy** with several artists, including Gerald Duchene, Mally Harpaz, Ember Rev, Ciara Clifford, Dan Ecclestone, Callum Gardner and more.

> Iâ€™ve worked with Simone on both my projects and his and the professionalism and quality of his work is world class. I have rarely had to give direction and he takes direction like an interested pro. Iâ€™m very partial to his style and tone. I hope to be still playing with him in the years to come. If you want a bass track that stands out and makes people sit up and listen, Simone is your man.
> <cite>â€” **Gerald Duchene**, [Antiquity](http://antiquity-music.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</cite>

> Simone mixed my bandâ€™s latest two albums. I worked closely with him during this process, using his Trello-based methodology to help sequence the work. Each song appeared as a series of tasks to be completed, checked and commented on. As a result, we were able to manage our time smoothly and efficiently. Creative ideas flowed back and forth. Iâ€™m looking forward to involving him in the next recordings!
> <cite>â€” **Dan Ecclestone**, [Ember Rev](https://emberrev.bandcamp.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</cite>

> In the band I started, Simone was the most involved with regards to arrangement and dynamics. Using his fretless bass, he completely switched the mood of any given part. Simone and I have been working on my new releases, and itâ€™s been an incredibly worthwhile experience. Itâ€™s great to have him with me to lead the production side and also to influence the arrangement. Iâ€™m really happy to have a producer that understands completely my process as a songwriter.
> <cite>â€” **Callum Gardner**, [Singer-songwriter](https://callumgardnerofficial.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</cite>

> When passion goes beyond working dutiesâ€¦ hereâ€™s Simone. Addiction and reliability are two great details you cant easily find nowadays in a professional and he gets both.
> <cite>â€” **Jean Claude Nouchy**, [Houdini FX technical director and trainer](http://www.visualcortexlab.com/showreel/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</cite>

> Whatâ€™s always impressed me about Simone is his attention to detail, which he demonstrates in every area of his work. Not only is he a prolific producer and bassist, but he easily comprehends and executes on the most abstract concepts across tech, audio, marketing, branding, and visual arts. When you work with Simone, everything is down, documented, and organised, which makes it very easy to work with him directly or in the context of a team.
> <cite>â€” **Christopher Carvalho**, [Unlock Your Sound](https://unlockyoursound.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</cite>

> Great co-worker! Very careful, serious and responsible, never superficial. Good webmaster with wide knowledge of the Apple world, the Adobe software and all thatâ€™s connected to audio engineering. Highly recommended.

> Simone is a gifted musician, producer and all round creative, with every project we have worked on being greatly improved by his talents. Impressive technical proficiency with various DAWâ€™s (ProTools, Wavelab, RX) as well as the creative knowledge to craft with them what ever is required for the project. When working with Simone, his precise and detailed manor make him an excellent addition to any project or team.

### Web design

Having started out in 1993 as a proofreader, I later evolved to editor and desktop publisher, learning the craft while working with renown editor Paola Varani for **RCS Rizzoli**, FrancoAngeli and others.

Fascinated by the web, in 1998 I deployed the first official site of a well-known historic [feminist bookstore in Milan](https://web.archive.org/web/20010808100700/http://fc.retecivica.milano.it/rcmweb/libdonne/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. During my years as a game audio designer, I kept refining my skills in web design and development. In fact, besides my audio duties, I was in charge for the game [companyâ€™s website](https://web.archive.org/web/20031208185857/http://www.playstos.com:80/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as well.

After freelancing for several years, I landed a long-term job as a front-end developer, working for large clients such as _UniCredit_. I resigned in 2011 after being hired for the same role by _Bodog_ in London, which is when I **moved to the UK**. In mid-2012, together with my previous co-workers at Bodog, [Silvia Maggi and Neil Palmer](https://web.archive.org/web/20161021065339/http://uifarm.co.uk/team/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, we co-founded the small design and development firm _UI Farm Ltd_, with offices in East London. We designed, developed and deployed advanced multi-device solutions for small to massive companies, including **Reevoo**, **UniCredit** and **Elite**.

A few years ago Iâ€™ve decided to go solo again, kick-starting _Minutes to Midnight_ in Cambridge. Embracing my wider skill set, I focused on both audio, music and web design. Over the last few months, Iâ€™ve been working on releasing and maintaining [several sites](#). My main focus is **ethic and sustainable design**, obtained through a relentless optimization of the web stack.

After many years with Drupal and WordPress, I now switched to **static site generators and headless CMSes**. My most recently deployed websites all rank <code>100</code> with Pagespeed.
