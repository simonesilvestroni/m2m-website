description: "As a cross-disciplinary polymath, I’ve been juggling between design and audio since the early 1990s. Here is some of my work as a sound and web designer."
excerpt: 'In 1995, while interning as an editor, I graduated as a <strong>bass player</strong>. Switched a few years later from the publishing industry to <strong>web design</strong>. After spending the following decades working as a <strong>game audio designer</strong> and a front-end developer between Italy and the UK, I gained a diploma at Berklee, specializing in music production, <strong>mixing</strong> above all.'

A representative selection of the [**27 recommendations** I received on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minutes2mid/).

> What’s always impressed me about Simone is his attention to detail, which he demonstrates in every area of his work. Not only is he a prolific producer and bassist, but he easily comprehends and executes on the most abstract concepts across tech, audio, marketing, branding, and visual arts. When you work with Simone, everything is down, documented, and organised, which makes it very easy to work with him directly or in the context of a team.

> My experience of working with Simone has always been very positive and enjoyable. Simone always takes a pragmatic and investigative approach to finding solutions for our needs and has very friendly and helpful attitude. His attention to detail makes him always deliver perfect coded products, saving us time and concerns on the web projects he develops.
