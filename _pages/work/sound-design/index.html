  <p>Initially self-taught, I had private tuition before enrolling for the CPM music institute in Milan and graduating with Stefano Cerri and Nicoletta Caselli. Been <strong>playing bass</strong> between Italy, the UK and with US-based acts, both <a href="/blog/live-shows/">live</a> and <a href="/work/sound-design/producing-bass-remotely/">in the studio</a>.</p>

  <p class="detached">Producing music since the 1990s, I properly focused on it over the last decade when I graduated at Berklee. <strong>Specialized in mixing</strong>, I strive to realize the artist's vision, adding creativity and delivering on time. I produced albums and singles in different countries with artists like Gerald Duchene, Mally Harpaz, Ember Rev, Ciara Clifford, Dan Ecclestone, Callum Gardner and more.</p>

  <p>I used to be the audio team leader for the game company Playstos Entertainment, with a title shipped at the end of the 2000s. I was in charge of directing the soundtrack, creating and editing the sound effects while co-ordinating a team of 2 sound designers and 2 audio programmers.</p>
