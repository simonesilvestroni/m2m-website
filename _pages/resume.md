## Skills and tools

### Sound design

Besides being a professional **`bassist`**, I'm an expert in **`music production`**, especially **`mixing`** and **`mastering`**.  After a long experience with **`Logic Pro`**, **`Pro Tools`** and **`Sound Forge`**, the tools I'm currently digging the most are **`REAPER`** and **`iZotope RX`**. After deciding to go back to **`game audio`**, I'm currently deeply involved in learning Audiokinetic's **`Wwise`** and **`FMOD`**. 

I also write and release original music and enjoy **`field recording`** and **`Foley`** techniques.

### Web design

I've been crafting websites from scratch with **`HTML`** and **`CSS`** since the late 1990s, later using **`PHP`** to generate the markup and **`SASS`** for the stylesheets. I adopted **`WordPress`** as my platform of choice since version 1.5, becoming an expert and building custom themes and plug-ins. I make a point of putting performance, **`usability`** and sustainability at the forefront. I'm well versed in graphic tools such as **`Figma`**, **`Sketch`** and DTP software like **`Adobe InDesign`**.

I can set up, run and maintain local and remote web servers in **`Apache`**, **`PHP`**, **`MySQL`** either through a GUI or **`SSH`**. I recently moved to **`JAMstack`** and static site generators with **`headless CMS`**, especially digging **`Jekyll`** with its **`Liquid`** template language and **`Netlify`** for deployment and production builds. I use **`git`** as a versioning system.
