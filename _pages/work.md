## Books and articles

In 2018 I wrote the free ebook [_Efficient Productivity for Music Professionals_](/work/project-management/) about project management in the music industry. Based on a real-life album production.

In 2019 I published on the Medium magazine "Lessons From History" the article _A Trip to Freedom, From Berlin to Berlin_. I described my personal journey towards retracing my grandfather's experience in 1940-1945, when he was deported to Sachsenhausen and then managed to escape a few days before the Soviets stormed in. This story was the basis for my debut album [_After 1989_](/work/music/after-1989/). After deleting my Medium account, I moved the [article to this website](/blog/after-1989-full-story/).
