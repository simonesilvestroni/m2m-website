summary: 'Welcome to the personal website where I document my thoughts, and how I use sound and web technology to turn ideas into an enjoyable experience. The moniker Minutes to Midnight references the <em>Doomsday Clock</em>, a connection with the world I grew up in during the Cold War.'

	<h2>What I stand for</h2>
	<p>Leading a quiet life in a time where noise, toxic controversy and anger have become dominant, is a struggle. Capitalism seems to favour abject things like patriarchy, racism, sexism, homophobia, and an incessant rush to accumulate wealth at the expense of people and the environment.</p>
	<p>I don’t contribute to this hive mind mentality, especially when fuelled by soulless corporations, and also stay away from the constant breaking news circus. I’ve expanded on these topics in <a href="{{ site.url }}/personal-manifesto/"><code>/personal-manifesto</code></a>.</p>

	<h2>What I do</h2>
	<p>While my small-town boy introversion is challenging in a raucous world, it has brilliant side effects. Helped by an eidetic memory, and the ability to hyper focus, I can dig deep into several interests, learning and honing new crafts over time. As a result, a peculiar skill of mine is the capacity to work comfortably in both creative and technical roles. </p>
	<p>After graduating from music school, I acquired production chops as a resident bass player and studio assistant during the 1990s. Attracted by tiny villages and metropolis alike, I moved to the big city, where I worked as a print designer and editor to fund my music activities. Seeing web design as a natural evolution of the publishing industry, I built my first website in 1997.</p>
	<p>Shortly after, I received an invite for a job interview with a company that was looking for a web developer who could also understand design. As they were starting production on a platform video game, I <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/joining-playstos/">landed the double role of sound and web designer</a>, bringing my duality to a full circle.<br><br></p>

	<h2>More</h2>
	<p>I care about accessibility, <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/tag/sustainability/">sustainability</a>, the environment. The recent renaissance of what is now called the <em>small web</em> pushed me to <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/website-minutes-to-midnight/">redesign my site and join the IndieWeb movement</a>.</p>
	<p>As part of the process, I have a <a href="{{ site.url }}/now/"><code>/now</code></a> page where I write down the things I'm involved with at the moment, a <a href="{{ site.url }}/blogroll/"><code>/blogroll</code></a>, and a <a href="{{ site.url }}/uses/"><code>/uses</code></a> page, with a list of the tools I use.</p>
