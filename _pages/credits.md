I handcrafted the site from scratch using [`Jekyll` v4.2.2](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Daily maintenance and content updates are achieved through a mix of templates in Sublime Text, the markdown editor Typora and macros within Alfred and Automator (macOS). Before downgrading my OS, I had devised [a method using Apple's Shortcuts](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/automation-for-my-blog-publishing-workflow/) that could be used with Monterey and later versions.

I keep my Ruby environment maintained through [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

## Code

- Good old `HTML`.
- `Markdown` [extended](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/).
- Plain `CSS` based on [Simple CSS](https://simplecss.org).
- Vanilla `Javascript` for [the search module](https://github.com/daviddarnes/jekyll-search-js) and [webmentions](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/webmention).
- Versioned on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonesilvestroni/m2m-website) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## UI

- Inline `SVG` for logos and icons.
- [`WebP` images](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/implementing-webp-images-in-jekyll/).
- Image optimization with [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com).
- I don't use custom fonts. System typography is good nowadays. [Geometric Humanist](https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks#geometric-humanist) is used on everything except for monospaced (ui-monospace), little serif interventions (Georgia and its fallbacks) and [Rounded Sans](https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks#rounded-sans) for labels.

## Sustainability

- I wiped out bloated frameworks. Now the entire source code is `1.1 MB`.
  <hr>
- Only [0.04g of CO<sub>2</sub> is produced every time someone visits the homepage](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/minutestomidnight-co-uk/), which is cleaner than 96% of web pages tested. 
  <hr>
- The website is running on sustainable energy and does not request third-party resources, except for the blog posts, which are calling `webmention.io` to render webmentions. 
  <hr>
- [Scores 100 on Ecograder](https://ecograder.com/report/CYFdKg62wGIsfEWJoa8uLAIE) and it's featured on [Lowwwcarbon](https://lowwwcarbon.com/showcase/).
  <hr>
- The markup is valid, the homepage loads in <mark>0.4 seconds</mark> and weighs <mark>112 KB</mark> (uncompressed). 
  <hr>
- Proud member of the [512kb club](https://512kb.club "Member of the 512kb Orange Team") and the [1Mb club](https://1mb.club/).

## Accessibility

- Despite the website resulting compliant with <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> guidelines based on multiple tests, I know it’s still incomplete.
- The page content is fully accessible with Javascript turned off. The dynamic [search engine](/search/) has an HTML alternative provided in the same page, based on DuckDuckGo.
