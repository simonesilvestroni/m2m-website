[Minutes to Midnight](/about/), music producer currently based in Milan (Italy), launched in 2019 a music project specifically to tell a real-life tale of imprisonment and liberty. [*After 1989: A Trip To Freedom*]({{ site.url }}/music/after-1989/) tells the story from his perspective as a grandson, who has only recently uncovered answers to how his grandfather managed to escape Germany in 1945. A modern-day attempt at storytelling, the album is a glimpse into hope.

> <span class="fs-3">The direct and immersive narrative allows history to speak for itself without being preachy or forced. The artist gives us a unique perspective of an outsider who manages to observe a great deal of pain without being directly subjected to it.  Its themes are timely and human, and effortlessly connect with a modern audience. _After 1989_ is an immersive and interesting experiment in storytelling that will leave listeners meditating on its heavy themes.</span>

> <span class="fs-3">The project is very impressive both in conception and execution. I love the way you’ve chosen to tell the story, the visuals, and the juxtaposition of the two Berlin experiences. It definitely reminds me a bit of Pink Floyd, both in the scope of the concept album but also the blues-influence that runs through the music and informs the whole thing stylistically. Congratulations on creating a work that tackles an immense subject and brings a great deal of emotional depth and insight into it.</span>
