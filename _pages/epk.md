## Industry reviews

> The direct and immersive narrative allows history to speak for itself without being preachy or forced. The artist gives us a unique perspective of an outsider who manages to observe a great deal of pain without being directly subjected to it.  Its themes are timely and human, and effortlessly connect with a modern audience. _After 1989_ is an immersive and interesting experiment in storytelling that will leave listeners meditating on its heavy themes.

> The project is very impressive both in conception and execution. I love the way you’ve chosen to tell the story, the visuals, and the juxtaposition of the two Berlin experiences. It definitely reminds me a bit of Pink Floyd, both in the scope of the concept album but also the blues-influence that runs through the music and informs the whole thing stylistically. Congratulations on creating a work that tackles an immense subject and brings a great deal of emotional depth and insight into it.
