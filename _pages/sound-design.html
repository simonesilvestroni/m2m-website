		<summary>Curriculum</summary>
		<p>A graduated musician, I freelanced as a bass player during the 1990s, acquiring audio skills as a studio assistant. Years later I landed a game sound designer role for a Playstation2 platformer. As team leader, I participated to the 2002 Game Developer Conference in San Jose, where I joined the Game Audio Guild Network on the day of its foundation, witnessing to the launch of Steam by Valve.</p>
		<p>I switched to the digital domain after building my studio, specialising in mix and master. I wrote and released songs as concept albums based on a personal storylines. While working as a music producer, mixer and bassist for independent artists, I published an ebook about project management in the music industry.</p>

			<li>Certified by Apple for Logic Pro, I later moved to Pro Tools, and finally REAPER. Iâ€™m also a passionate Reason user.</li>
