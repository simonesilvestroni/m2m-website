## Sustainability

Only `0.02g of CO2` is produced every time someone visits the homepage. Cleaner than `98%` of [web pages tested](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/minutestomidnight-co-uk/ "Visit Website carbon"). The website is running on sustainable energy.

I [do not request third-party resources](https://aremythirdpartiesgreen.com/test/76e7ac7370d84f1fabd254608e118ff4), except for the blog posts, which are calling `webmention.io` to render web mentions.
