## Privacy

Things that I **don't do**:

- Collect personal data beyond an email address if you [subscribe to my newsletter](/newsletter/)
- Run analytics software
- Run ads
- Use affiliate links
- Add tracking scripts
- Shove idiotic pop-ups or modal windows in your face

[Unless you tell me](/contact/), there is no way for me to know you've been here. A full [content security policy](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/content-security-policy/) has been implemented.

## Design

I subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_ by David Bryant Copeland.

> A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.<cite>â€”&nbsp;[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)</cite>

In line with a minimalist approach, fighting against bloatware means that this website keeps resources at the bare minimum. It doesn't weigh on broadband and electricity with useless scripts, tracking, ads or pointless stock photos.

## Decentralization

Part of [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), this website is capable of sending and receiving [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), a quasi-web standard for replying, liking and reposting from one's own website.

I quit and [deleted my account](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/escape-from-social-media/) on all mainstream centralized social networks in August 2020. I still have a presence on Spotify but I don't care about it and don't engage with it in any form.

I only interact with people online on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@m2m).

## I pay for the tools I use

I support <abbr title="Free and Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> projects, including the Mastodon instance that hosts my account, _and_ closed-source software built by small companies with a well-thought business model. None of them have a marketing department gaslighting their customers or plastering ads everywhere. A few examples:

- [Cockos](https://cockos.com/)
- [Klanghelm](https://klanghelm.com/contents/main.html)
- [Tokyo Dawn Labs](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tokyo-dawn-labs/)
- [Voxengo](https://www.voxengo.com/)
- [Sublime HQ](https://www.sublimehq.com/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

I don't pirate software.

## Walled gardens

After stopping being attached to a particular brand, becoming _system agnostic_ has become second nature. Most of the software I use, with rare exceptions, can be installed and run from any operating system.

A software business model based on subscriptions [doesn't get my money](/blog/waves-switched-to-subscription-and-people-are-angry/). Moreover, I don't depend on _ecosystems_. Albeit slightly less convenient, it gives me considerable freedom.

## Upgrades

I'm opposed to upgrades _for the sake of it_. It means that I only follow security updates, bug fixes and actual new useful features.

I stopped caring for any arbitrary yearly cycle of forced fake novelties. If it's part of a _planned obsolescence_ strategy, it stays out.
