## Corporate web

I dislike all facets of the current corporate internet, whether that be centralised social media or whatever turned the web of the late 1990s in the current dystopia we’re living in.

I've been forced to put systems in place so that I can browse the internet in peace, without being constantly bombarded by ads, pop-ups, modal windows and whatnot. This is *not fun*.

I refuse to take an active part in services who profit from people being distracted, envious and anxious. Hence, [why I quit](/blog/life-after-social-networks/) Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit years ago and never joined TikTok or SnapChat. Even though I have an account with YouTube and Spotify, I don’t engage with either.

## Decentralisation

I think of my site as [part of the small web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/). If I have an online identity, it's represented by this manifesto and what I post on my website, rather than a *projected persona* with scattered posts crafted to attract attention on a corporate-owned social network.

Two years ago I joined the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/). Being an independent node of the web, this website is capable of sending and receiving webmentions, a method for replying, liking and reposting from one's own website.

I only interact with people online using email and [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@m2m).

## Sustainability

Over the last fifteen years I've been heavily invested in trying to stop wasting resources. I put my outmost attention to sustainability in every aspect of my life, including web design.

I subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_ by David Bryant Copeland:

> A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.<cite>—&nbsp;[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)</cite>

In line with a minimalist approach, fighting against bloatware means that my website doesn't weigh on neither broadband nor electricity with useless scripts, tracking, analytics, ads or pointless stock photos.

For the same reasons, I refuse to take part in anything related to the blockchain. Not that is [going great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) anyway.

## Accessibility

Helped by professionals such as [Silvia](https://silviamaggidesign.com/about/), I made my website [as accessible as possible](https://webaim.org/projects/million/lookup?domain=minutestomidnight.co.uk).

If a website is not catered to everyone, it has little to no use.

## Digital ecosystems, or walled gardens

As another facet of sustainability, I also refuse the corporate-filled idea of feeling attached to a brand. Ever since I stopped doing so, being _system agnostic_ has become second nature.

The most common method to gradually force people into digital ecosystems, or *walled gardens*, is through offering convenience. Not being trapped with having to buy devices or use software from the same company, gives me considerable freedom. It might cost me a couple steps more to keep things in sync, so be it.

Similarly, a business [model based on subscriptions](/blog/waves-switched-to-subscription-and-people-are-angry/) doesn't get my money.

## Planned obsolescence

All the aforementioned methods are used by their creators to induce [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) to bring people to spend more money. A progressive increase in waste is one of the direct results. 

Another sneaky aspect is the arbitrary cycle of forced software upgrades, usually on an annual basis. Apple is likely the worst offender here. Not caring for it, I [downgraded my laptop](/blog/degrowth/) to an operating system from 2018. It works very well, I have sufficient security updates and I don't use obsolete packages from Apple.

## Right to repair

Rather than buy the shiny new object, I prefer to [maintain and repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) my hardware whenever possible. My current daily ride, a MacBook Pro from 2015, is still going strong and I don't plan to switch anytime soon.

## I pay for the tools I use

I support <abbr title="Free and Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> projects, including the Mastodon instance that hosts my account, _and_ closed-source software built by small companies with a well-thought business model. None of them have a marketing department gaslighting their customers or plastering ads everywhere. A few examples:

- [Cockos](https://cockos.com/)
- [Klanghelm](https://klanghelm.com/contents/main.html)
- [Tokyo Dawn Labs](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tokyo-dawn-labs/)
- [Voxengo](https://www.voxengo.com/)
- [Sublime HQ](https://www.sublimehq.com/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

I don't pirate software.
