## Privacy

I don't collect personal data, don't run analytics software, ads, affiliate links or tracking. [Unless you tell me](/contact/), there is no way for me to know you've been here.

A full [content security policy ↗](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/content-security-policy/) have been implemented.

## Design

I subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_ by David Bryant Copeland.

> A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.<cite>—&nbsp;[Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)</cite>

In line with a minimalist approach, [fighting against bloatware](/colophon/) means that this website keeps resources at the bare minimum. It doesn't weigh on broadband and electricity with useless scripts, tracking, ads or pointless stock photos. Over the last two years, I reduced the overall size by roughly <mark>724 MB</mark>.

## Decentralization

> Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and ‘convert’. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.<cite>—&nbsp;Parimal Satyal</cite>

Part of [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), the website is capable of sending and receiving [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), a quasi-web standard for replying, liking and reposting from their websites.

I can be found on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@m2m).

## Tools

After stopping being attached to a particular brand, becoming _system agnostic_ has become second nature.

Pretty much all the software I use, with rare exceptions, can be installed and run from any operating system.

I don't use pirated shit.

## Walled gardens

A software business model based on subscriptions [doesn't get my money](/blog/waves-switched-to-subscription-and-people-are-angry/). Similarly, I don't depend on _ecosystems_. Albeit slightly less convenient, it gives me considerable freedom.

I'm more than happy to support <abbr title="Free and Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> projects and brilliant for-profit companies such as [Cockos](https://cockos.com/), [Klanghelm](https://klanghelm.com/contents/main.html), [Tokyo Dawn Labs](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tokyo-dawn-labs/) and [Sublime HQ](https://www.sublimehq.com/). Small but solid entities that can move swiftly when needed, with a well-thought business model that doesn’t rip off customers.

None of them have a marketing department gaslighting their customers or plastering ads everywhere.

## Updates

I'm opposed to updates _for the sake of it_. It means that I only follow security updates, bug fixes and actual new useful features.

At the same time, I stopped caring for any arbitrary yearly cycle of forced upgrades. If it's part of a _planned obsolescence_ strategy, it can stay out.

## Newsletter

If you subscribe to my newsletter, I will collect your email address, which will be safely stored. It will be used solely to send you emails. I do not share it with third parties. You can unsubscribe at any moment via the link in any newsletter.
