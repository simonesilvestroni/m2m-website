- 🪴 Getting the garden, and a few new plants, ready for the spring.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Still working on CV and portfolio, I just completed a full migration from Netlify to [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com) (thanks to Leon Paternoster for the precious advice), and I'm very happy about the change.
- 📚 Reading the first book of the *Wool* trilogy, by Hugh Howey.
- 📺 After finishing rewatching _12 Monkeys_ (the TV show), I watched the BBC series _Detectorists_, which I loved.
