After 10 years in England, I’ve been temporarily living in the north of Italy. I'm in the process of moving back to the UK.

Currently studying video game audio middleware tools, in particular Audiokinetic's Wwise. I've recently mastered the soundtrack for a documentary about cycling that's about to be released. All my other creative work is on stand-by.

I'm reading the first book of the _Wool_ trilogy, and a couple of others, mostly connected to the so-called *years of lead* that happened in Italy during the 1970s. Besides playing retro games with my new 8bitdo pro controller, I've finally started dwelling again into my favourite genre: puzzle platformers — namely: _Limbo_, _Journey_, and _Golf Club Nostalgia_.
