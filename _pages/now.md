- 😳 I’ve been growing accustomed to the unbelievable fact that, after a 3-year hiatus abroad, we’ve re-settled in the same house in Cambridge where we previously lived for 5 years.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Working on my resume and portfolio, so that I can start seeking a day job back in web design/development.
- 📚 Reading two books, concurrently: *Wool*, by Hugh Howey, and *Leave the World Behind*, by Rumaan Alam.
- 📺 After rewatching _Life On Mars_, _Ashes to Ashes_, *Sex Education*, and _Ghosts_ in their entirety, my wife and I are enjoying the shows by Professor Brian Cox that we'd missed over the last few years. We’re clearly focused on re-immersing ourselves in British culture.
