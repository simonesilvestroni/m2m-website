## Work

{: .list-hr }
- I'm studying video game audio middleware tools, such as Wwise and FMOD, and their integration with game engines (Unity and Unreal). I want to get up to speed with game audio technology after [a long hiatus](/work/sound-design/ruff-trigger-playstation2-game/).
- The short-term goal is to complete a good sound design reel.
- I've recently mixed an [album by Ember Rev](/blog/mix-ember-rev-reaper-subprojects/) and mastered the soundtrack for a documentary about cycling that's about to be released.
- All my creative work is on stand-by: both the follow-up to _After 1989_, and the German remix of _Skinny Kid_ (in collaboration with [Bea Henkel](https://beartemusic.com/the-story/)).

## Personal

{: .list-hr }
- I just started reading [_Internet for the people_](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/2674-internet-for-the-people) by Ben Tarnoff.
- As a man of nostalgia, I'm currently playing all sorts of retro games, from old Arcade staples (_Scramble_, _Time Pilot_, _Puzzle Bobble_, _Mega Zone_, _Galaga_, _Super Mario_ etc) to a few PlayStation 2 releases from the early 2000s, which include _Jak and Daxter_, _Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex_, _Mafia_ and _Ico_.
- Recently purchased _Gris_ on Steam — haven't started yet.
- I've been rediscovering a talent for cooking, that I thought I had lost.
