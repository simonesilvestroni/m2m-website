- ✈️ Back from the first trip abroad, visiting my parents. It was a nice time, but knowing that we wouldn't have to stay in our home country beyond a few days helped a lot.
- 👨🏻‍💻 After redesigning and reorganising my websites, I'm working on CV and portfolio, even though I already started applying to job adverts.
- 📚 Reading the first book of the *Wool* trilogy, by Hugh Howey. Finally [dropped *Leave the World Behind*]({{ site.url }}/blog/book-review-leave-the-world-behind/), by Rumaan Alam.
- 📺 Rewatching _12 Monkeys_, the TV show.
