**Life**: my wife and I have just moved back to the UK, re-settling in the same house in Cambridge where we previously lived for 5 years. 

**Work**: my sabbatical, spent studying video game audio middleware tools, in particular Audiokinetic's Wwise, is hopefully nearing its conclusion. I'm also open to part-time web design roles in Britain. 

**Books**: I'm currently unable to read much due to the re-settling activities. 

**Media**: To unwind, and reconnect, I'm rewatching the whole _Ashes to Ashes_ series from the BBC. A few days ago we went to the cinema&nbsp;—&nbsp;first time in years — and watched _Dream Scenario_.
