This is a _now page_, from a brilliant idea by Derek Sivers. It tells what I’m really focused on at this point in life. If you have your own site, [you could make one, too](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Where?

After 10 years in England, I'm currently living between the shores of Lake Maggiore and Milan. The plan for 2023 is to go back to the UK, hopefully soon because <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/making-mistakes/">I don't fit in my native country</a>.

## Sound design

Since the goal is to get hired by a video game company, I'm studying the audio middleware tools **Wwise** and **FMOD** and their integration with game engines such as **Unity** and **Unreal**. Despite [my past experience](/work/sound-design/ruff-trigger-playstation2-game/), I want to get up to speed with game audio technology after a 15-years hiatus.

As part of my daily routine, I'm practicing field recording, Foley, sound design creation with synthesis (in particular using Phase Plant by Kilohearts), editing and finalizing the production with [REAPER](/blog/tag/reaper/).

The short-term goal is to complete a good sound design reel.

## Music

With the follow-up album to [_After 1989_](/work/music/after-1989/) currently in stand-by, I'm laying down the structure for the German remix of my song _Skinny Kid_.

## Reading

I struggle to focus on one book at a time. My Kobo tells me I'm reading something in the range of 18 books. However, I’ve recently managed to focus on [*Kallocain* by Karin Boye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallocain).

## Growth?

I'm convinced that there is no future without the acceptance that humanity needs to face [degrowth](/blog/degrowth/) as a proper voluntary choice. I've been involved with it, and minimalism, for a while now.

## Online communities

I've been making fruitful conversations and connections on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@m2m) and [Airwiggles](https://www.airwiggles.com/home).
