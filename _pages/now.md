## Where am I?

After 10 years in England, I'm temporarily living between the shores of Lake Maggiore and Milan. The plan for 2023 is to move back to the UK, hopefully soon because <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/making-mistakes/">I don't fit in my native country</a>.

## Sound design

Since the goal is to get hired by a video game company, I'm studying the audio middleware tools Wwise and FMOD and their integration with game engines such as Unity and Unreal. Despite [my past experience](/work/sound-design/ruff-trigger-playstation2-game/), I want to get up to speed with game audio technology after a long hiatus.

As part of my daily routine, I'm practicing field recording, Foley, sound design creation with synthesis (in particular using Phase Plant by Kilohearts), editing and finalizing the production with [REAPER](/blog/tag/reaper/).

The short-term goal is to complete a good sound design reel.

## Music

With the follow-up album to [_After 1989_](/work/music/after-1989/) currently in stand-by, I'm slowly working on the structure for the German remix of my song _Skinny Kid_, in collaboration with [Bea Henkel](https://beartemusic.com/the-story/).

I've recently mixed an [album by Ember Rev](/blog/mix-ember-rev-reaper-subprojects/) and mastered the soundtrack for a documentary about cycling that's about to be released.

## Video games

I'm a man of nostalgia, fond of quietness and rarefact ambiences, so currently playing ~~[Gris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gris) and [Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game))~~ all sorts of retro games, from old Arcade staples (_Scramble_, _Time Pilot_, _Puzzle Bobble_, _Mega Zone_, _Galaga_, _Super Mario_ etc) to a few PlayStation 2 releases from the early 2000s, which include _Jak and Daxter_, _Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex_, _Mafia_ and [_Ico_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ico).

## Reading

I struggle to focus on one book at a time. My Kobo tells me I'm reading something in the range of 18 books. I put [*Kallocain* by Karin Boye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallocain) on hold, and switched to _This Is What It Sounds Like_ by Susan Rogers and Ogi ogas.

## Online communities

I've been making fruitful conversations and connections on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@m2m) and [Airwiggles](https://www.airwiggles.com/home).
