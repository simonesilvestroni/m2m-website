- ✈️ Back from the first travel abroad, visiting my parents. It was a nice time, but knowing that we wouldn't have to stay in our home country beyond a few days helped a lot.
- 👨🏻‍💻 After redesigning and reorganising my websites, I'm working on CV and portfolio. Applied to the first job advert online, waiting for a response.
- 📚 Still reading two books concurrently: *Wool*, by Hugh Howey, and *Leave the World Behind*, by Rumaan Alam. I'm finding the latter boring and increasingly irritating.
- 📺 Rewatching _12 Monkeys_, the TV show.
