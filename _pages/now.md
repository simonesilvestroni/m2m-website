I’ve been growing accustomed to the unbelievable fact that, after a 3-year hiatus abroad, we’ve re-settled in the same house in Cambridge where we previously lived for 5 years.

I’m working on my resume and portfolio, so that I can start seeking a day job back in web design/development next year.

Reading two books, concurrently: *Wool*, by Hugh Howey, and *Leave the World Behind*, by Rumaan Alam. Enjoying the former way more, at the moment.

After rewatching the _Life On Mars_ and _Ashes to Ashes_ series from the BBC, and *Sex Education* in its entirety (we’re clearly focused on immersing ourselves in British culture), my wife and I are enjoying a few comedies specifically made for the holidays.
