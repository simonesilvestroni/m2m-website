This is a _now page_, from an idea by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).

**Life**: my wife and I are in the process of moving back to our house in Cambridge, UK — _the same house where we lived there for 5 years_ — talk about serendipity. **Work**: my sabbatical, spent studying video game audio middleware tools, in particular Audiokinetic's Wwise, is hopefully nearing its conclusion. I'm also open to part-time web design roles (in the UK), which I'm going to act upon once settled. **Books**: I'm currently juggling between the first book of the _Wool_ trilogy, and the new book by Christopher Wylie about Cambridge Analytica.

Everything else is currently in stand-by.
