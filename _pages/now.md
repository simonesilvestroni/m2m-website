- 🪴 The garden is flourishing, with new plants, new vegetables, new flowers.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Completed my online portfolio, and started applying for a new job. The mini-website for the portfolio is the first offspring of my—still in its infancy—custom Jekyll/SASS own custom framework. I got rid of all third parties, and I'm very happy with it. Can't wait to transform this website using the same personal tech.
- 📚 Reading too many books at the same time, as usual. *Wool*, by Hugh Howey, Johnny Marr's autobiography, and a ton of essays.
- 📺 Silvia and I have been watching British TV shows from the 1980s and 1990s, including _Blackadder_ and _The Young Ones_.
