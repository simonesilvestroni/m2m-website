This is a _now page_, from a brilliant idea by Derek Sivers. It tells what Iâ€™m really focused on at this point in life. If you have your own site, [you could make one, too](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Where?

Currently living between the shores of Lake Maggiore and Milan. The plan for 2023 is to go back to the UK, hopefully soon because <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/making-mistakes/">I'm not happy in my native country</a>.

## Sound design

Since the goal is to get hired by a video game company, I'm studying the audio middleware tools **Wwise** and **FMOD**. Despite my past experience, I want to get up to speed with game audio technology after a [15-years hiatus](/work/game-audio/console-game-ruff-trigger/). 

The main focus is on Wwise: I've already completed the 101 and 201 courses, while right now I'm at the final stages of 251. I haven't decided on whether trying to get certified or not.

As part of my daily routine, I'm practicing field recording, Foley, sound design creation using synthesis, editing and finalizing the production with [REAPER](/blog/tag/reaper/).

The short-term goal is to complete a good sound design reel.

## Music

While I'm laying down the structure for the German remix of my song _Skinny Kid_, I'm also planning a follow-up album to [_After 1989_](/work/music/after-1989/). Currently, I'm at the preliminar synopsis stage.

## Reading

Heavily struggling to focus on one book at a time. My Kobo tells me I'm currently reading something in the range of 17 or 18 books. If I had to narrow down to the three books I've been more focused on I'd say: _Stasiland_ by Anna Funder, _Everything That Remains_ by Joshua Fields Millburn and _Industrial Society And Its Future_ by Ted Kaczynski.

## Growth?

I'm convinced that there is no future without the acceptance that humanity needs to face [degrowth](/blog/degrowth/) as a proper voluntary choice. I've been involved with degrowth and minimalism for a while now.

## Online communities

I've been making fruitful conversations and connections on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@m2m) and [Airwiggles](https://www.airwiggles.com/home).
