I've been studying video game audio middleware tools, in particular Audiokinetic's Wwise and its integration with the game engine Unity. I want to get up to speed with game audio technology after [a long hiatus](/work/sound-design/ruff-trigger-playstation2-game/), and complete a good sound design reel.

I've recently mastered the soundtrack for a documentary about cycling that's about to be released. All my other creative work is on stand-by.

Currently reading [_Johnny Marr - the Smiths & the Art of Gunslinging_ by Richard Carman](https://archive.org/details/johnnymarrsmiths0000carm).

As a man of nostalgia, I'm currently playing all sorts of retro games, from old Arcade staples to a few PlayStation 2 releases from the early 2000s, which include _Jak and Daxter_, _Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex_, _Mafia_ and _Ico_. Recently purchased _Gris_ and _Journey_ on Steam — haven't started yet.

I've been rediscovering a talent for cooking, that I thought I had lost.
