I’ve been growing accustomed to the unbelievable fact that, after a 3-year hiatus abroad, we’ve re-settled in the same house in Cambridge where we previously lived for 5 years.

Working on my resume and portfolio, so that I can start seeking a day job back in web design/development next year.

Reading two books, concurrently: *Wool*, by Hugh Howey, and *Leave the World Behind*, by Rumaan Alam.

After rewatching the _Life On Mars_ and _Ashes to Ashes_ series, and *Sex Education* in its entirety, my wife and I are enjoying the show _Ghosts_ on BBC iPlayer. We’re clearly focused on re-immersing ourselves in British culture.
