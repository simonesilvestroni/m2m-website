Life: after 3 years of self-imposed exile in our home-country, my wife and I are in the process of moving back to Cambridge, UK. Work: my sabbatical, spent studying video game audio middleware tools, in particular Audiokinetic's Wwise, is hopefully nearing its conclusion. Books: I'm currently juggling between the first book of the _Wool_ trilogy, and the new book by Christopher Wylie about Cambridge Analytica.

Everything else is currently in stand-by.
