After 10 years in England, I’ve been temporarily living in the north of Italy. I will be moving back to the UK as soon as I can.

Currently studying video game audio middleware tools, in particular Audiokinetic's Wwise. I'm going to be applying for a sound designer position, after [a long hiatus](/work/sound-design/ruff-trigger-playstation2-game/).

I've recently mastered the soundtrack for a documentary about cycling that's about to be released. All my other creative work is on stand-by.

Currently reading a couple of books connected to the so-called *years of lead*, that happened in Italy during the 1970s, and playing retro games, from old Arcade staples to PlayStation 2 releases from the early 2000s. Recently purchased _Gris_ and _Journey_ on Steam — haven't started them yet.
