		<li>🪴 The garden is flourishing, with new plants, new vegetables, new flowers.</li>
		<li>👨🏻‍💻 Completed my web design online portfolio, and started applying for a new job. The mini-website for the portfolio is the first offspring of my—still in its infancy—custom Jekyll/SASS own custom framework. I got rid of all third parties, and I’m very happy with it. Can’t wait to transform this website using the same personal tech.</li>
		<li>📚 Reading too many books at the same time, as usual. <em>Wool</em>, by Hugh Howey, Johnny Marr's autobiography, and a ton of essays.</li>
		<li>📺 Silvia and I have been watching British TV shows from the 1980s and 1990s, including <em>Blackadder</em> and <em>The Young Ones</em>.</li>
