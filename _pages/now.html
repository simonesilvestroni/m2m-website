		<li>🪴 Despite a beautiful start, spring has momentarily disappeared. All our seedlings have been moved to the conservatory.</li>
		<li>👨🏻‍💻 Looking for a job has become a soul crushing chore. Not sure about what's going on. The positive thing is that, after completing my online portfolio, I ported this personal website to my own SCSS custom framework. Getting rid of third party dependencies feels awesome.</li>
		<li>📚 Still reading too many books at the same time, as usual. Since 27 open books in my Kobo wasn't enough, I've added <em>Digital Minimalism</em>, by Cal Newport. Not sure if I want to read it in its entirety though, as I see it more like a manual to consult here and there.</li>
		<li>📺 Silvia and I have been watching beautiful films recently. Besides <em>Poor Things</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em>, I was treated yesterday with <em>The Taste of Things</em>. Our quest to connect with British 1980s/1990s comedy included <em>The Thin Blue Line</em>.</li>
