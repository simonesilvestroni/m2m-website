## Newsletter

I only send one when I actually have updates to share, mostly about releases or facts from the audio, game and web industries. You can reply directly and start a conversation: I always respond. Check the archive of [previous newsletters](https://us17.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=dd893fb89a7ad82c176b2527b&id=d54c366fbf).
