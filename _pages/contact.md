## Hire me

I’m available for hire: [reach out via email](mailto:hello@minutestomidnight.co.uk) and let me know what do you need help with. We’ll take it from there. 

If you need bass tracks or production, it's possible to hire me through [SoundBetter](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/206552-minutes-to-midnight){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a safe and secure platform to hire freelance musicians.

## Get in touch

To start a direct conversation or ask for advice, I'm reachable on [Telegram](https://t.me/minutes2midnight){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It&rsquo;s also possible to follow me on the following platforms:

<div class="alert alert-background-d-10" role="alert">
  <p class="fs-5"><kbd class="fw-bold">What about the usual social media?</kbd> — While I had never opened accounts with TikTok and Snapchat, in the summer of 2020 <a href="/blog/escape-from-social-media/">I deleted</a> my Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>

## Newsletter

I only send one when I actually have updates to share, mostly about **releases** or *facts* from the **audio, game and web industries**. You can reply directly and start a conversation: I always respond.
