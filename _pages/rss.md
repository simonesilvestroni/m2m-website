I have an RSS feed for <a href="/feed.xml">the blog</a> and another for <a href="/newsletter.xml">the newsletter</a>.

## What is RSS?

Web feeds are also known as <abbr title="RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feeds.

Use web feeds to subscribe to websites and get the latest content in one place. Feeds put you in control. To know more: [About Feeds](https://aboutfeeds.com/).
