I have an RSS feed for <a href="/feed.xml">the blog</a> and another for <a href="/newsletter.xml">the newsletter</a>.

## What is RSS?

Web feeds are also known as <abbr title="RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feeds.

Use web feeds to subscribe to websites and get the latest content in one place. Feeds put you in control. It’s like subscribing to a podcast, or following a company on social media. You don’t need to pay or hand over your email address: get the latest content without having to visit lots of sites and without cluttering up your inbox. 

Had enough? Easy: unsubscribe from the feed. You just need a special app called a newsreader.
