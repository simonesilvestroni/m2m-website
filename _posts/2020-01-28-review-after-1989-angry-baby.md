## About Angry Baby

Angry Baby has been sharing new music from outstanding independent musicians for a while now and we have amassed a collection of great tunes for you to enjoy. All you have to do is pop your email address in the box and a bumper collection of music will be on itâ€™s way to you. The music comes from outstanding artists that you may not have heard before. With a mix of rock, pop, folkâ€¦ you name itâ€¦ thereâ€™s bound to be something new that floats your musical boat, and all for free!

> Throughout _After 1989_, Simone uses archive material to accentuate the music and narrative, and the commentary speaks to our collective experiences of the last sixty years. Yet, you remain aware that the album is also a personal journey and one familyâ€™s history â€“ the story and the music will stay with you long after the music finishes.
