## Notes

Being on streaming platforms is not a must-have for me, yet I wanted to have these two songs in a couple of playlist that are useful for my portfolio. This was the occasion for experimenting with the [digital distributor Amuse](https://www.amuse.io/). I'd say it's been a pretty smooth â€” and free â€” experience. All the credits were correctly exported to Spotify, including production.
