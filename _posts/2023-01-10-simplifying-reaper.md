I'm going to be quick and straight to the point: no matter how much experience I have with the software, I've found the act of removing custom keyboard shortcuts and turning them into a new toolbar very refreshing.

The other step I've taken was to reduce the number of key strokes necessary to hit a shortcut: wherever possible they're now down to 1 or max 2. Pretty much every shortcut requiring more than two modifiers have been moved to a toolbar.

Less mental load is good.

Also, the new dimmed customized colour palette, similar to ProTools' is soothing to my eyes. Especially useful when coupled with [SWS auto-coloring tracks and regions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYUKduPumIM) based on common prefixes.

What can be seen in the following screenshot:

- A new toolbar at the top
- The session navigator right below
- A full arrange window, complete with markers and regions
- Several auto-colored tracks
- A mixer channel strip for the selected track, on the left (a-la Logic)
- The master mixer channel strip, on the right
- Transport bar at the bottom
