description: 'I read an article on The Atlantic titled <em>The Endless Cycle of Social Media</em>, missing the subtitle about Threads by Meta. Slightly amusing nonetheless.'

I usually couldn't care less about the topic of what Meta do or don't do with their time and money, but found the [interview by Lora Kelley to Charlie Warzel on _The Atlantic_](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/threads-meta-twitter-competitor-mark-zuckerberg/674655/) entertaining and a bit baffling. 

Here's the bit I enjoyed the most:

> It blows my mind, because I think about all the hostility toward Meta since 2016 — privacy, [Cambridge Analytica](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-in-three-paragraphs/556046/), [politics](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/), [Myanmar](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/could-facebook-be-tried-for-war-crimes/548639/), the bungling of the [metaverse](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/). Then there’s this notion that Mark Zuckerberg is uncool, and Facebook is uncool and bad. And then they dropped this product, and people are like, *Oh, thank God, finally I have a place to go to post my thoughts!*
