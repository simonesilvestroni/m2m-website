Most of the following points are interconnected. The glue that keeps them together is **mental health**. Modern capitalism has made a clear point in exploiting stress and weaknesses in people to make money. It's disgusting, and I hope more people will take decisive steps to safeguard their well being.

## Being real

This website represents myself online. I don't need to project a successful persona here, nor fake anything. Owning the site, both the code and the content, has a real meaning. And yes, [I love it](https://anhvn.com/posts/2021/2021-12-14-i-love-my-website/).

> I love my website. Even though it isn’t a physical thing, I think it might be my most prized possession.<cite>[Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/articles/10887)</cite>

I first created a personal website in March 2002, changing its domain, design and content over 21 years. It's true that I now also offer services in exchange for money, however, this is my _personal place_ and therefore I don't cater to a specific category of people. I'm myself, [not a brand]({{ site.url }}/blog/de-brand/).

I rarely swear online, but I'm never afraid to call a spade a spade.

## Be kind, rewind

Should be a given. Unfortunately, it _needs to be said_: I try to be as kind as possible, listen to everybody (except for fascists) and avoid being judgmental. Also, and I cannot stress enough about this, whenever I make a mistake, I'm able to apologise and correct myself.

## Privilege

I despise patriarchy and misogyny. Even though I relentlessly refuse to participate in locker room talk, I'm well aware of the advantages I have as a white man raised in a Western country. I keep this in mind.

## Attention span

I refuse to take an active part in services profiting from people being distracted, envious and anxious. Hence, why I quit Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit years ago and never joined TikTok or SnapChat. Even though I still have an account with YouTube and Spotify, I don’t interact on those sites.

## Breaking news

I stopped following the news, which doesn't mean I ignore what's happening in the world. A system based on creating anxiety, fake urgency and designed to keep people on their toes stays out of my life. If it's not an in-deep analysis, a long-form article or a book, it doesn't get my attention. This [article by Rolf Dobelli](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli) is a good starting point.

> Exploitative, performative, informative<br>
And we don't know the half of it<br>
Rhetorical, deplorable, historical<br>
And all along we called it normal
<cite>Paramore, [_The News_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFa_wOZPXg)</cite>

## Corporate web

Being in my fifties means that I started hanging around the internet in the 1990s. IRC, BBSes, Usenet newsgroups, Eudora, Fort&eacute; Agent — those things.

I dislike all facets of the current corporate-lead internet, whether that be centralised social media, gigantic monopolies, and whatever else turned the so-called _web 1.0_ into the current dystopia we’re living in. Having to put systems in place to browse the internet in peace, without being constantly bombarded by ads, pop-ups, modal windows and whatnot, is *not fun*.

I'll never support this shit.

## Decentralisation

I think of this site as [part of the small web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/). My online identity is here, and not in a *projected persona* that scatters ephemeral posts crafted to stir controversy and attract attention on a corporate-owned social network. A few years ago I joined the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/). As an independent node of the larger internet, I don't need a comment system: I can send and receive [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), a method for replying, liking and reposting from personal websites.

For more ephemeral discussions, I interact with people online using Mastodon.

## Sustainability

Over the last fifteen years I've been heavily invested in trying to stop wasting resources. I put my outmost attention to sustainability in every aspect of my life, including web design. I subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_:

> A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.
> <cite>[David Bryant Copeland](https://brutalist-web.design/)</cite>

In line with a minimalist approach, fighting against bloatware means that my website doesn't weigh on neither broadband nor electricity with useless scripts, tracking, analytics, ads or pointless stock photos. For the same reasons, I refuse to take part in anything related to the blockchain. Not that is [going great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) anyway.

## Accessibility

Helped by professionals such as [Silvia](https://silviamaggidesign.com/about/), I made my website [as accessible as possible](https://webaim.org/projects/million/lookup?domain=minutestomidnight.co.uk). If a website is not catered to everyone, it has little to no use.

## Digital ecosystems, or walled gardens

As another facet of sustainability, I also refuse the corporate-filled idea of attaching myself to a brand. Ever since I stopped doing so, being _system agnostic_ has become second nature. The most common method to gradually force people into digital ecosystems, or *walled gardens*, is by offering convenience. Not being trapped with having to buy devices or use software from the same company, gives me considerable freedom. It might cost a couple steps more to keep things in sync — so be it.

Similarly, a business model based on subscriptions doesn't get my money.

## Planned obsolescence

All the aforementioned methods are used by their creators to induce [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) and bring people to spend more money. A progressive increase in waste is one of the direct results. A sneaky aspect is the arbitrary cycle of upgrades, usually on an annual basis. Apple is likely the worst offender here. Since I care about [degrowth]({{ site.url }}/blog/tag/degrowth/), ~~I downgraded my old laptop to an operating system from 2018. It works very well, and I have sufficient security updates~~ I started using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) and upgraded my now unsupported Mac to the latest operating system.

The same thing happens with my Android phone: old, cheap, and running the [latest system with ease](/blog/installing-android-13-on-an-unsupported-non-google-phone/).

## Right to repair

Rather than buy the shiny new object, I prefer to [maintain and repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) hardware whenever possible. My current daily ride, a MacBook Pro from 2015, is still going strong and I don't plan to switch anytime soon.

## I pay for the tools I use

I support <abbr title="Free and Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> projects, including the Mastodon instance that hosts my account, _and_ closed-source software built by small companies with a well-thought business model. None of them have a marketing department gaslighting their customers or plastering ads everywhere. 

A few (multi-platform) examples:

- [Cockos](https://cockos.com/)
- [Klanghelm](https://klanghelm.com/contents/main.html)
- [Tokyo Dawn Labs](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tokyo-dawn-labs/)
- [Voxengo](https://www.voxengo.com/)
- [Sublime HQ](https://www.sublimehq.com/)
- [Typora](https://typora.io/)
- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)

I don't pirate software.
