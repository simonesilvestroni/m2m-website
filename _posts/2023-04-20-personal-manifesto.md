Most of the following points are interconnected. The glue that keeps them together is _mental health_. Modern capitalism has made a clear point in exploiting stress and weaknesses in people to make money. I find it disgraceful, and my hope is that more people will take decisive steps to safeguard their well being.

## Being real

This website represents myself online. I don't need to project a successful persona here. Owning both the code and the content has a real meaning, and [I love it](https://anhvn.com/posts/2021/2021-12-14-i-love-my-website/). I first created my website in 1997, starting a blog in 2002. I've changed its domain, design and content over many years. I might also offer services in exchange for money, however, this is my _personal place_, therefore I don't cater to a specific category of people. [Being a brand is a thing of the past]({{ site.url }}/blog/de-brand/).

## Be kind, rewind

Should be a given. Unfortunately, it _needs to be said_: I try to be as kind as possible, listen to everybody (except fascists), and don't be judgmental. Also, whenever I make a mistake, I'm able to apologise and correct myself. I rarely swear online, but I'm never afraid to call a spade a spade.

## Privilege

I despise patriarchy, racism, sexism, homophobia. Even though I relentlessly refuse to participate in locker room talk, I'm well aware of the advantages I have as a white man raised in a Western country.

## Attention span

I refuse to take an active part in services profiting from people being distracted, envious and anxious. Hence, why I quit Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit years ago and never joined TikTok or SnapChat. Even though I still have an account with YouTube, I don’t interact on the site, preferring RSS instead.

## Breaking news

I stopped following the news, which doesn't mean I ignore what's happening in the world. A system based on creating anxiety, fake urgency, and designed to keep people on their toes stays out of my life. If it's not an in-depth analysis, a long-form article or a book, it doesn't get my attention. This [article by Rolf Dobelli](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli) is a good starting point.

## Corporate web

As a gen X, I started hanging around the internet in the 1990s. <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>, <abbr title="Bulletin Board System">BBS</abbr>es, Usenet newsgroups, Eudora, Fort&eacute; Agent — those things. I dislike all facets of the current corporate led internet, whether that be centralised social media, gigantic monopolies, and whatever else turned the so-called _web 1.0_ into the current dystopia. Having to put systems in place to browse the internet in peace, without being constantly tracked, bombarded by ads, pop-ups, modal windows and whatnot, is *not fun*.

I'll never support this crap.

## Decentralisation

I think of this site as [part of the small web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/). A few years ago I joined the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/). As an independent node of the larger internet, there's no need for a comment system. I can [send and receive webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), however, private conversations are more in line with my ethos. For more ephemeral discussions online, [I use Mastodon](https://sonomu.club/@m2m).

## Sustainability

Over the last fifteen years I've been heavily invested in trying to stop wasting resources. I put my outmost attention to sustainability in every aspect of my life, including web design. I subscribe to the _brutalist design manifesto_.[^1] In line with a minimalist approach, fighting against bloatware means that my website doesn't weigh on broadband or electricity with useless scripts, ads or pointless stock photos. For the same reasons, I refuse to take part in anything related to the blockchain. Not that is [going great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) anyway.

## Accessibility

Helped by professionals such as [Silvia](https://silviamaggidesign.com/about/), I made my website [as accessible as possible](https://webaim.org/projects/million/lookup?domain=minutestomidnight.co.uk). If a website is not catered to everyone, it has little to no use.

## Digital ecosystems, or walled gardens

Another facet of sustainability, I also refuse the corporate-filled idea of attaching myself to a brand. Ever since I stopped doing so, being _system agnostic_ has become second nature. The most common method to gradually force people into digital ecosystems, or *walled gardens*, is by offering convenience. Not being trapped with having to buy devices or use software from the same company, gives me considerable freedom. It might cost a couple steps more to keep things together — so be it. Similarly, a business model based on subscriptions doesn't get my money.

## Planned obsolescence

All the aforementioned methods are used to induce [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence), and force people to spend more money. One direct result is a progressive increase in waste. The arbitrary cycle of upgrades, usually on an annual basis, is another way to push perfectly working devices to the landfill. As I have an old Apple computer, I started using [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/), and upgraded my unsupported machine to the latest operating system. The same thing happens with my Android phone: old, cheap, and running the [latest system with ease](/blog/installing-android-13-on-an-unsupported-non-google-phone/).

## Right to repair

Rather than buy the shiny new object, I prefer to [maintain and repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) hardware whenever possible. My current daily ride is still going strong: a MacBook Pro from 2015 that I don't plan to change anytime soon.

## I pay for the tools I use

I support <abbr title="Free and Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> projects, including the Mastodon instance that hosts my account, _and_ closed-source software built by small companies with a well-thought business model. None of them have a marketing department gaslighting their customers or plastering ads everywhere. A few examples: [Cockos](https://cockos.com/), [Tokyo Dawn Labs](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tokyo-dawn-labs/), [Sublime HQ](https://www.sublimehq.com/), [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

I don't pirate software.
