summary: 'After ditching the concept of <em>personal brand</em>, here I go with a few principles I stand for. Is there a point in hiding behind a mask?'

Most of the following points are interconnected, glued together by an attention to *mental health*. Modern capitalism has made a point in exploiting stress and weakness to relentlessly extract money from people. I find it disgraceful, and my hope is that more folks will take decisive steps to safeguard their well-being.

## Be real

I don't need to project a successful persona. This website represents myself, therefore owning both the code and the content has a [real meaning](https://anhvn.com/posts/2021/2021-12-14-i-love-my-website/). I first created my website in 1997, and the blog in 2002, while changing domain, design and content several times over the years. This is my *personal place*, therefore I don't cater to a specific category of people. [Being a brand is a thing of the past]({{ site.url }}/blog/de-brand/).

## Be kind

Should be a given, but unfortunately, it *needs to be said*: I try to listen to everybody (except fascists), without being self-righteous and judgmental. Also, when I make a mistake, I'm able to apologise and correct myself. I rarely swear online, but I'm never afraid to call a spade a spade.

## Privilege

I despise patriarchy, racism, sexism, homophobia. Even though I relentlessly refuse to participate in locker room talk, I'm well aware of the advantages I have as a white man raised in a Western country.

## Distraction

I refuse to be part of services profiting from people being distracted, envious and anxious. For this, I quit mainstream social media. Even though I still have a YouTube account, I don’t interact on the site, preferring RSS instead.

## News

I stopped following the news, which doesn't mean I ignore what's happening in the world. A system based on creating anxiety, fake urgency, and designed to keep people on their toes stays out of my life. If it's not an in-depth analysis, a long-form article or a book, it doesn't get my attention.

## Corporate web

As a gen X, I started hanging around the internet in the 1990s. <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>, <abbr title="Bulletin Board System">BBS</abbr>es, Usenet newsgroups, Eudora, Fort&eacute; Agent — those things. I dislike all facets of the current corporate-led internet, or whatever else turned the so-called _web 1.0_ into the current dystopia. Having to set up multiple systems in order to browse the internet in peace, without being tracked, bombarded by ads, pop-ups, modal windows and whatnot, is *not fun*. I'll never support this crap.

## Decentralisation

I think of this site as part of the [small web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/), and the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/). I don't feel the need for a comment system, however, I can send and receive [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/). Private conversations are more in line with my spirit. For ephemeral discussions online, I use [Mastodon](https://sonomu.club/@m2m).

## Sustainability

Over the last 15 years I've been heavily invested in trying to stop wasting resources. I put my outmost attention to sustainability in every aspect of my life, including web design. I subscribe to the *brutalist design manifesto*.[^1]

Fighting against bloatware means that this website doesn't weigh on broadband or electricity with useless scripts, ads or pointless stock photos. For the same reasons, I refuse to take part in anything related to the blockchain, or <abbr title='Large Language Models'>LLM</abbr> (or "AI", as the hype calls it).

## Accessibility

With crucial help by [Silvia Maggi](https://silviamaggidesign.com/about/), I made my website [as accessible as possible](https://webaim.org/projects/million/lookup?domain=minutestomidnight.co.uk). If a website is not catered to everyone, it has little to no use.

## Digital ecosystems, or walled gardens

Another facet of sustainability, I loathe the corporate-filled idea of attaching myself to a brand. Ever since I stopped doing so, being *system agnostic* has become second nature. The most common method to gradually force people into digital ecosystems, or *walled gardens*, is by offering convenience.

Not being trapped with having to buy devices or use software from the same company, gives me considerable freedom. It might cost a couple steps more to keep things together — so be it. Similarly, a business model based on subscriptions doesn't get my money.

## Planned obsolescence

All the aforementioned methods, used to induce [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence), are forcing people to spend more money, and waste even more natural resources. The arbitrary cycle of upgrades, usually on an annual basis, is another way to push perfectly working devices to the landfill.

As I have an old Intel-based Apple computer from 2015, I use [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) to run the latest acceptable operating system (Ventura, in my case) on my unsupported machine. The same thing happens with my Android phone: obsolete, but running the [latest system with ease](/blog/installing-android-13-on-an-unsupported-non-google-phone/).

## Right to repair

Rather than buy the shiny new object, I prefer to [maintain and repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) hardware whenever possible. The vast majority of my devices, and music equipment, is 5-year-old or more. They work very well, and I don't plan to change the situation.

## I pay for what I use

I don't pirate software. I support <abbr title="Free and Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> projects, including the Mastodon instance that hosts my account, *and* closed-source software built by small companies with a well-thought business model. None of them have a marketing department gaslighting their customers or plastering ads everywhere. A few examples: [Cockos](https://cockos.com/), [Tokyo Dawn Labs](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tokyo-dawn-labs/), [Sublime HQ](https://www.sublimehq.com/), [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).
