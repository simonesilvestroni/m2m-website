It’s Saturday, time for some new music. I’ve been following the online magazine **Indierepublik** (formerly <em>Indie Berlin</em>) for a while now, even from before they wrote a [really good review for _After 1989_](/work/original-productions/after-1989/). They caught my attention with an [article they published](https://www.indierepublik.com/music/cameron-hassard-releases-his-debut-mini-album-rings-and-it-packs-a-punch/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} a couple of days ago, a review for the new album by **Cameron Hassard**, titled _Rings_.

The promise of an album presenting itself like a movie, narrated by an artist that sounds a bit like **Mark Lanegan**, was alluring enough. So I went, and what a surprise. This is a great finding — treat yourself with this gem of an album, either on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7i7LkY24PkJBNgcfgj04d5?si=X3V5Qv2EQk-vpLWyTXuGqQ){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [Bandcamp](https://cameronhassard.bandcamp.com/album/rings-2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Here’s an appetizer:

_Rings_ was produced and recorded at Berlin’s [Famous Gold Watch Records](https://thefamousgoldwatch.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by Cameron James Laing (Universal).
