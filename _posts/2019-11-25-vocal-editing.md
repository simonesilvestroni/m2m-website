## Vocal transformation

After the [demo stage of my album]({{ site.url }}/blog/after-1989-demos/) _After 1989_, I scrapped a song called _Niemandsland_, featuring a marvellous vocal performance by Rachel Goodman. Since the lyrics were critical for the concept, I repurposed them for the new lead single _Skinny Kid_. Despite the two songs having different tonality and tempo, I decided to salvage Rachel's parts as backing vocals and counterpoint to Dan Ecclestone's lead.

### Before &amp; after

Rachel Goodman's performance in _Niemandsland_ (an unpublished demo scrapped in 2017) and the same chorus section edited and adapted for _Skinny Kid_. The tempo jumped from `78` to `105`.

The painstaking process of transforming a vocal performance from one song to another was done using Logic Pro and Soundtoys. Working on both the pitch and the _formant_, I strived to obtain a new track that sounded coherent with the new lead single without showing notable artifacts.

## Robert F. Kennedy eulogy clean-up

I love restoring audio for historical speeches. A famous eulogy given by Robert Francis Kennedy in 1968 after Martin Luther King's assassination was [used in this song](https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/track/requiem). iZotope RX was the only tool I used.
