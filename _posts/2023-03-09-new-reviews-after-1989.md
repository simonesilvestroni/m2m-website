description: 'My debut concept album has been receiving a bit more attention recently, especially after I stopped trying to sell it.'

Whether the new influx is determined by my choice to stop acting like [a seller who needs to monetise a product](/blog/de-brand/) or not, I'm happy to see fresh reactions from people I don't even know. It takes a minimal effort to write a review on Bandcamp (I'm guilty of being constantly behind my to-do list on this matter), however few people do. From [the Bandcamp page](https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/album/after-1989-a-trip-to-freedom):

> Superbly crafted thematic album, with each song contributing to the overall experience. 
<cite>David Dellacroce</cite>

> What a powerful piece of work. I would like to see it performed in Germany and England.
A musical and historical journey with depths.
<cite>BeaK</cite>

> The crystal clear mix, the engrossing story, the lovely bass. I’ll often end up with the chorus to ‘Skinny Kid’ stuck in my head without warning.
<cite>Mykie Frankenstein</cite>

> This album straight up changed my ideas of what kind of music I could write myself. Huge inspiration. 
<cite>Garrett Mickley</cite>

I'm very thankful for the lovely feedback, especially for a 4-year-old album.
