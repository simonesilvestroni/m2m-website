description: 'Second post in my ‘degrowth’ series. How I approach the news online, including blogs, videos, newsletters.'
---
I'm off real-time news: no 'breaking', no 'live reporting'. Instead, I read long-form articles from trusted sources such as [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/). I don't have an account on Medium, Substack or any other Silicon Valley <abbr title="Venture Capitalist">VC</abbr>-funded centralised proprietary thingy. My anxiety levels are already in a dreadful state, without the need of added stress from constant news intake. No algorithm, no _everything now_, I choose what and when to read.

## RSS feeds

Cutting off the news doesn't mean I don't know what's going on in the world, in fact, I've been using RSS for many years now. [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) is my current daily platform where I follow the websites that interest me, organised under the categories:

- Personal blogs.
- Sound and tech-related websites.
- Facts from the game and music industries.
- Info from the government, mostly [gov.uk](https://gov.uk).
- YouTube subscriptions.
- Notifications of any webmentions that my website might receive.
- Newsletters, to keep my email clean.

## Pocket

I collect interesting links and videos from various sources (including Feedbin) on [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), which parses web pages like the well-built _reader view_ in Firefox. There, I have a flexible and efficient routine:

- Go through my read list using the in-built filters (video, article, etc).
- Consume the longest articles [on my Kobo](https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017763753-Use-the-Pocket-App-with-your-Kobo-eReader), thanks to its Pocket integration. Reading articles on a retro illuminated e-ink device is orders of magnitude better, in my opinion.
- I also send the most interesting videos from Feedbin to Pocket. By doing so, I never visit YouTube's website, which saves me from both its "social" features and the suggestions algorithm. It's why I have not (yet) deleted the account.
