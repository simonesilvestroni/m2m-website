## Production notes

_Eclipse_ is a new single, part of a different batch of new releases, where I upped the ante and played three different electric bass parts. Despite being out of my usual go-to genres, I enjoyed the experience. All bass tracks, dry and distorted, are played with my [1991 Warwick Thumb](/uses/).

## Credits

**Music, production** / Lenny Nathan Frumento  
**Bass, production, mix, master** / Minutes to Midnight
