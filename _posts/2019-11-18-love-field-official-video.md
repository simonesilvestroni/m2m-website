**Dallas, November 1963** â€” Warm weather and cheering crowds greet the President when he lands at Love Field airport. As the motorcade cuts through the city, I fantasise about waving at Jack and Jackie, or leaning over the window of a sixth floor, or being Abraham Zapruder, standing still while everything changes.
