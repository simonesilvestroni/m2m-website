description: 'Cheering crowds greet the President at Love Field, the Dallas airport. As the motorcade cuts through the city, I imagine to be there, standing still while everything changes.'
---
November 1963. A warm weather greets the President when he lands at _Love Field_. Following the motorcade, I fantasise about waving at Jack and Jackie, or leaning over the window of a sixth floor, or being Abraham Zapruder, standing still while everything changes.
