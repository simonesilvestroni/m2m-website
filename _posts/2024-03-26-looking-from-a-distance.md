Several months after returning to the UK — back from the 3-year-long limbo spent in my home country — the endless ruminations on the pain of having gone back to Italy brought me to a simple conclusion: it actually was a good thing.

On a gut level, the immediate consideration is that I was given time and distance to see Britain from afar, appreciating the many positives that the *Brexit years* had corroded. Being able to revisit a long-time experience with a different and more honest point of view fills me with gratitude. Or, as my wife aptly wrote, [it made us realise where home is](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/home-again/).

The deepest positive, though, one that will likely have long-term ramifications, was the chance to reconnect with people, both family and friends. Despite the angst of constantly being a guest in someone else's house for such a long time, I didn't realise until the very end how I loved spending time with important people from my past, dear friends that I thought I had lost touch with. We got to spend many months with three of them, in one case sharing the same apartment where we had been living together for six years, two decades ago.

We're adults now, of course everything feels different. A communal life is not an aspiration anymore, and adapting wasn't straightforward. Inevitably, leaving our home country in 2011 had brought the obvious inability to share the same cultural mindset. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the feeling of a sometimes awkward newfound connection, more than its opposite.

In another case, being somewhat forced to share the same space carried something that I now see with some degree of nostalgia: long deep chats under the summer moon, a stone's throw from the sea, with the evening waves quietly crashing on the beach. Or cycling 10 kilometres back and forth, in the pine forest, crossing the canal on the old ferry boat, and eat amazing meals with my family while laughing at their well-known old tales. That was *precious*, almost like a second chance.

My fucked-up home country, messy, frustrating, often incomprehensible Italy. I loved you for those bittersweet moments.
