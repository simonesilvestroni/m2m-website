Like the previous singles, [_Hang Loose_]({{ site.url }}/blog/callum-gardner-hang-loose/) and [_Wriggle A Little_]({{ site.url }}/blog/callum-gardner-wriggle-a-little/), I recorded and produced the single, along with playing my Fender Jazz [fretless bass](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/206552-minutes-to-midnight).
