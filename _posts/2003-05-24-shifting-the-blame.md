> I don’t get it. How can a large part of 40 people sacrifice their lives for someone else’s dream, here, in this very office? I don’t really care for the project we’ve been working on. Maybe I did, at the beginning. Now? Being genuine has become counterproductive. If I want to leave by 7PM, I either have to make up excuses, or lie. If I want time off I have to call in sick. A simple “I work hard, but after 9 hours I create more bugs than I should be fixing” doesn’t get me anywhere, as the reply would be “just work 11 hours and shut up”. I don’t like this direction, it’s not mine, I don’t want that to engulf me.

Also, do you see how we work hard to avoid mistakes, not because we care, but because otherwise we would get dissed by the technical director during meetings?

I don’t get it either. Whenever I stay beyond 7PM, I actually work on my personal website, browse the internet, do personal tasks. Then, after fifteen minutes or so, I disappear into thin air.

I think I’ve been clutching at straws, I keep hoping that this place might go back to when it worked well. Wishful thinking, I know. Last week, one of my peers cried because he was getting fired. We fought for him and later were criticised because, and I quote your (former?) friend G., *it’s not personal*. Then, after reinstating the guy, they somehow promoted him to a *Head of production* role, and basically asked him to spy on us, which he gleefully did. Can you believe it?

The leaders are currently trying to blame people who were in this project since the beginning. You were right, when you showed me that mechanism of shifting the blame onto the workers at the bottom of the chain. They’re taking themselves out of the equation, hence, they’re never responsible for any failure.

Something truly disheartening: they’re taking away the love we used to have for this job.
