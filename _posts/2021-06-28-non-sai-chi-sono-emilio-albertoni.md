The idea included an album of original songs and a companion EP of remixes of the same material, produced by friends and former collaborators. Gianluca asked Emilio and I to choose a song to our liking and produce a remix together. We had complete creative freedom, and several months at our disposal. After listening in isolation to an early demo of the album, we both selected the same song: *Non so chi sei* (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know you‚Äù).

Included in the new EP *Aperture*, *Non sai chi sono* is our remix, released on Bandcamp and other streaming platforms on June 28, 2021.
