I’ve listened to her in awe. In particular, regarding two points:

- The importance of using panning to make the most of our perception of music, by exploiting the different way our brain processes sounds. I love how both Pensado and Trawick reacted to it.
- The crucial role that _non-musicians producers_ can have on the global vision of a song.

I strongly advise you to watch the entire interview — it’s slightly over 45 minutes, while the ‘core’ of the discussion is probably around half an hour. Skip to around `3'08"` for the proper part to start.
