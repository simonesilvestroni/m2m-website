All the info can be found in the rewritten [about page](/about/).

Our projects for 2023 are Emilio’s debut album and Minutes to Midnight’s follow-up concept to the successful [*After 1989: A Trip to Freedom*](/work/music/after-1989/).

After producing the single [*Non sai chi sono*](/work/music/non-sai-chi-sono/) together, Emilio and I have been working on a few projects, including [Arva Vacua’s debut EP](/blog/arva-vacua-debut-ep/) and the upcoming EP for the band IsadoraD.
