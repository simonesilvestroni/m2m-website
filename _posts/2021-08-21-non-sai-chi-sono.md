## Backstory

January 2020, an old friend and former music partner, [Gianluca Lo Presti](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0ugkXokPU3KaXX3X9BFes7), had recently lost his father. A new album dedicated to reflecting on their time together was in the works. The idea included a companion EP of remixes, done by friends and former collaborators.

Gianluca asked Emilio Albertoni and I to choose a song to our liking and produce a remix together. We had complete creative freedom, and several months at our disposal. After listening, in isolation, to an early demo of the album, we selected the same song: _Non so chi sei_ (“I don’t know you”).

Then Covid arrived. After a few months and several chats, Emilio would start drafting ideas in Logic and send them over. Simone would then see his direction and decide how to interact with his own production.

> I’ve been collaborating with Gianluca for twenty years, somehow picking up Simone’s baton right after he left Ravenna in the mid-Nineties. When we met last year, in a foggy wintry night, we couldn’t possibly know that a global pandemic was around the corner, nor that we would have worked together remotely, despite ironically living so close.

## Interpretation

The first draft sounded completely new compared to the original, yet perfectly retaining its spirit. More than 90% of our demo material ended up in the final master.

Simone wrote the bass part in a way that was coherent with Emilio’s tracked line, but at the same time convey the fractured feelings expressed in the song. He also added back a section of Gianluca’s vocals, cut in a way that would slightly twist the meaning, creating _a mirror of the original title_. This is how we ended up re-titling our remix _Non sai chi sono_ (“You don’t know me”).

We wanted to make this a dialogue, where the original song and our remix approached the father-son relationship from different point of views.

## Production notes

> Production-wise, I remember playing my fretless bass over and over against Emilio’s demo while I still was in the UK planning my departure. It was a very stressful time: the pandemic was approaching its second peak in the country, my wife and I wanted to leave as soon as we could.<cite>&mdash; Simone Silvestroni</cite>

After re-settling in his coastal Italian hometown, Simone managed to work on his side of production. Added the vocals, the bass, reorganized the samples, recorded a new rhythmic section in the chorus, along with an original Italian TV announcement of Nixon’s victory in 1968.

The spoken words of Gianluca’s father — recorded by himself on tape at the time — is featured all along, like a vocal journal of his preparations for a work trip in Iraq in the same year. At the beginning, tenderly speaking to his wife, he states the date: the day before Nixon was announced as the new President of the US.

## Collaboration

We exchanged opinions about the rough mixes, efficiently collaborating to the editing until we both felt the song was complete. After starting the work in Logic, both the mix and the master were done in Pro Tools.

> We strived to reach out to the core of the song — but also moving to a different territory — respectful of our different musical paths. Simone is outstanding at giving context to songs and laying down elegant credible bass lines. He built rhythmic parts, strenghtening and tying together the tension that I created with my guitars and synths.
