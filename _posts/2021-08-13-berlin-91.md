When I visited Berlin for the first time, shortly after the wall collapsed, it was also the first time I fell in love. I wandered through the no manâ€™s land that was Potsdamer Platz at the time, holding my ruby-red hair girlfriendâ€™s hand. I stood still, looking at the buildings on the east side, with their creepy bricked windows facing the west. The German Democratic Republic was history, and so was the Cold War.

_Berlin 91_ is actually the first video of [_After 1989_](/work/original-music-productions/after-1989/) I worked on, two years ago. In a suggestive room in Copenhagen, I spent a few hours editing footage shot by Derek Williams in 1990 (thanks Derek! â€” see credits below). The genuine approach, along with the fact his images perfectly reflected my memories of Berlin in those days, convinced me.

My work on the video surely is naive and unpolished, but shows a first approach. I wanted that to stay raw, on purpose.
