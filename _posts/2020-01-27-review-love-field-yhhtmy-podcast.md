## About YHHTMY

[_You Haven't Heard This Music Yet_](https://www.youtube.com/@YHHTMPC) is a podcast exploring unheard music, which they feel is as good if not better than that of the mainstream. With challenges laughs and banter along the way.

A quote from their review of _Love Field_:

> It really impacted me, I listened to the entire album which is something I rarely do with submissions.
> <cite>YHHTMY</cite>
