## Production

After listening to the rough mix of _Shallow Grave_, I almost immediately decided to approach the song with my Fender Jazz fretless bass. The song asked for a mellow and warm sound, and that’s what I’ve delivered. I’m grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with such an [experienced and solid musician](https://antiquity-music.com/).

Also, I love when I’m presented with a proper challenge. As a songwriter, Gerald writes very differently from what I usually work with, and he has a pretty different approach from the material [I usually produce]({{ site.url }}/work/). Therefore, I have to dive into the spirit of the music first, feel how the song moves. I end up using a kind of sensitivity that doesn’t come easy to me. To elaborate on how I perceive a challenge in music, I often quote a David Bowie interview as a pivotal inspiration:

> If you feel safe in the area that you’re working in, you’re not working in the right area. Always go a little further, into the water than you feel capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you feel that your feet are not quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting.
