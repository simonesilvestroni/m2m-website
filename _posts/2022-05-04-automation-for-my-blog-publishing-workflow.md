Ever since I went live with a redesigned Jekyll-based website, I‚Äôve been looking for ways to improve my publishing workflow. I prefer working with a static website rather than a CMS such as WordPress, yet there are methods to make this process more efficient. This is a work in progress, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be adding new bits to this post in the future.

A few weeks ago I saw a few links posted on Mastodon about the frustrations of maintaining a static web site. [Ru Singh](https://rusingh.com/why-bother-with-static-sites/) argued about the complexity that takes away the pleasure of writing. A couple of follow-ups by [Michael Harley](https://obsolete29.com/posts/2022/03/10/why-i-bother-with-static-sites/), who uses Eleventy, and [Luke Harris](https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2022/04/easier-static-site-publishing/), who uses Hugo, showed different point of views while still aknowledging similar problems.

I can understand the issues, yet none of them particularly apply to me. However, it‚Äôs true that I‚Äôve been honing my process more and more, looking for a way where ideally I end up clicking an icon or dragging a file into a folder and a few minutes later the post would be done. Read the post [*Taking Shortcuts* by Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/taking-shortcuts/) to get what I‚Äôm talking about.

I thought about it and asked *what are the most annoying parts of writing a new post?* Arguably, the answer would be twofold: first, **the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) block**, which is the top YAML-based section in a static site generator post; second, **adding an image**.

## My goals

1. Streamline the process of writing new posts, where a sort of *wizard* would guide me throughout compiling all the repetitive bits until an editor appears and I just have to write the content.
2. Improve the way I add images to a new post as much as I can. What I have in mind is to select one or more images, drag them onto an app and have them: 
   - web-friendly renamed;
   - converted to WebP;
   - moved to `_assets/images`;
   - have a <kbd>figure</kbd> ‚Äúshortcode‚Äù ready to be pasted in my post, complete with all the required info: <kbd>width</kbd>, <kbd>height</kbd>, <kbd>alt</kbd> text and <kbd>caption</kbd>.


## Before: automation using Sublime Text and Alfred

### New Jekyll post with Sublime Text

I used to call my post template from the command palette in Sublime Text by typing <kbd>Jekyll: new post from template</kbd>. It prompted me for a title, after which a file was created in `_posts`, with today‚Äôs date followed by a web-friendly translated version of the title I just input. I still had to manually fill in **6 empty fields** in Front Matter. 

### Add images with Alfred

I‚Äôve been using macros and similar for a while, namely with [Alfred‚Äòs workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/). It involved building a kind of *shortcode system* for Jekyll and associate a key binding to each object. This is an example:

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/shortcode-figure.gif" alt="Short animation of how I embed a figure tag" caption="Embedding a figure tag using Alfred" width="690" height="200" %}

The key binding <kbd>/figure</kbd> called my Jekyll ‚Äúshortcode‚Äù for the HTML element `figure` and then I would manually complete the missing <kbd>000</kbd> parameters. I could have added detailed query prompts in Alfred, asking me for more data but I didn‚Äôt feel the need. After reading Robin‚Äôs post I thought I could vastly improve it using macOS‚Äô new [Shortcuts](https://www.xda-developers.com/guide-shortcuts-macos/) app. I went as far as upgrading my OS to Monterey.

{: .alert .alert-background-d-10 }
**Sidenote** ‚Äî I sorely miss the time when Apple simply released new apps that were available to download on several versions of OS X, but this is a rant for another day. The upgrade went well, unexpectedly fast with no issue whatsoever. I can honestly say it‚Äôs behaving better than all the previous OS updates that followed Mavericks. We‚Äôll see.

## Now: Shortcuts

I‚Äôve been using [Automator](https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac) for years and I love it. After a couple of days fiddling with Shortcuts I noticed how its modern incarnation doesn‚Äôt always agree with me. It looks powerful, yet it sometimes feels buggy[^1] and convoluted, with a sub-par [documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac/welcome/mac). As usual with new things, it took me a while to understand how the new app *thinks*.

As of this writing, I have 3 automation processes in place that I'm happy about. A fourth one is still in its infancy and not yet ready. They‚Äôre all apps exported in `~/Applications` and also present in my <kbd>Quick actions</kbd> contextual menu.

### New Jekyll post with Shortcuts

The following short video demonstrates the process in real time.

{: .alert .alert-background-d-10 }
**Note**: when the Terminal is shown, there‚Äôs a Jekyll compile issue: that‚Äòs my fault as I‚Äôve done this video twice and forgot to delete the previous test post with the same title. üôà

{% include pattern-video.html id="oAO2caYnF08" %}

Here is the whole routine of the _wizard_:

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/jekyll-automations-new-post.png" alt="Shortcuts app for creating a new Jekyll post" caption="Shortcuts app for creating a new Jekyll post" width="505" height="1517" %}

Brief analysis of what the above app is doing:

{: .list-group .list-group-flush .mt-0 .ps-0 }
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }1Ô∏è‚É£ Asks for a post <kbd>title</kbd> and sets a variable using the input I provide in a pop-up.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }2Ô∏è‚É£ Same for the <kbd>category</kbd>.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }3Ô∏è‚É£ Same for a couple of <kbd>tags</kbd> (I can add more later if I need). This time sets a variable containing an array of both my subsequent inputs.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }4Ô∏è‚É£ Asks for the description, which goes in my <kbd>description</kbd> field in Front Matter, used for SEO purposes in my website.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }5Ô∏è‚É£ Same for the <kbd>excerpt</kbd> which is printed below the main heading.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }6Ô∏è‚É£ Runs a bash script where I pass the <kbd>title</kbd> variable as an argument and does a few things that I was unable to achieve using native Shortcuts elements:
  - {: .my-2 }**Creates a file** in the correct folder, named with today‚Äôs date followed by the <kbd>title</kbd> variable (in the script I convert spaces with dashes and turn everything lowercase).
  - {: .my-2 }Adds the Front Matter section and fills it with all the variables I previously created.
  - {: .my-2 }**Launches my markdown editor Typora** which opens the file with a compiled Front Matter section.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }7Ô∏è‚É£ Runs an AppleScript that opens a minimized session in the Terminal with my alias for running the `npm` task that holds both Jekyll build and SASS compile actions.

### Adding images to a post with Shortcuts

{: .alert .alert-background-d-10 .mb-4 }
üö® **Opinionated sidenote** ‚Äî When I used a CMS, I could drag a huge photo to a media library because it would take care of resizing ‚Äî and maybe optimization through a plug-in or two. *Regardless of how much I could streamline that workflow* on a CMS, it‚Äôs not my cup of tea. Being too [conscious about sustainability](http://localhost:4000/blog/on-the-concept-of-frugal-computing/), I find the idea of having my website carry a redundant amount of  images sub-optimal.

The process I follow for adding images to a blog post in Jekyll is made of 5 stages:

{: .list-group .list-group-flush .mt-0 .ps-0 }
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }1Ô∏è‚É£ Resize and compress so it‚Äôs web-safe and as light as possible, usually using [GraphicConverter](https://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/graphicconverter/) and [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) on macOS.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }2Ô∏è‚É£ Rename to a web-friendly format.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }3Ô∏è‚É£ Make a `.webp` version.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }4Ô∏è‚É£ Move to the correct folder, in my case `_assets/images`.
- {: .list-group-item .ps-0 }5Ô∏è‚É£ Add <kbd>width</kbd> and <kbd>height</kbd> to the `figure` tag.

So far, I‚Äôve manually taken care of the first step. I have a Shortcuts automation in its infancy which is trying to deal with this. If I manage to reach the same level of compression-quality ratio as I do with GraphicConverter, I‚Äôll make the switch.

Even though I tried to manage the whole process with Shortcuts, I have to split the process in two. That‚Äôs because I want to still apply steps 2-4 to **multiple images**, while I prefer to add one image at a time to my post.

Now, the images workflow is reduced to 2 steps:

- **Renaming and copying images to Jekyll‚Äôs assets**: select image(s) and right-click ‚Üí <kbd>Quick actions</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>M2M images</kbd>.
- **Inserting new images in a post**: select the image I want to add to my post from `_assets/images` and right-click ‚Üí <kbd>Quick actions</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>Jekyll insert figure</kbd>.

I can either right-click and use the quick actions or drag the image to the Dock, where I keep the app version of the same automations.

#### Video demo

{% include pattern-video.html id="K0AKv7aIxP8" %}

#### Breakdown

There are 3 pictures on my Desktop, all named incorrectly with wrong spaces and capitalizations:

- `evil CORP.png`
- `FRIEND.jpg`
- `fux socy.JPG`

First, I drag them onto my <kbd>M2M images</kbd> app. The app transforms file names into web-friendly versions, replacing spaces and other characters with dashes and turning the file names lowercase. Then it performs a conversion to `.webp` with a 85% quality factor and finally move everything to my Jekyll image folder.

The shell scripts added at the end contains the following code:

```bash
for f in "$@"
do
/usr/local/bin/cwebp -q 85 "$f" -o "${f%.*}.webp" && mv "$f" /Users/m2m/@ARCHIVE/2022/wwM2M/m2m-website/assets/images && mv "${f%.*}.webp" /Users/m2m/@ARCHIVE/2022/wwM2M/m2m-website/assets/images
done
```

The final action takes the selected image, fetches <kbd>width</kbd> and <kbd>height</kbd> while asking for <kbd>alt</kbd> and <kbd>caption</kbd> in a pop-up text prompt. This is the script:

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/jekyll-automations-insert-figure.png" alt="Shortcut automation for inserting an image in a Jekyll post" caption="Shortcut automation for inserting an image in a Jekyll post" width="545" height="960" %}

The trick is to collect the required information, store it in variables which I then use to compile my `figure` Jekyll module in a text block. The output is simply sent to the clipboard, ready to be pasted in my post. From the video, this was the resulting code that I pasted in the editor:

```html
{% raw %}{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/evil-corp.png" alt="this is the alt" caption="a caption here" width="2560" height="1440" %}{% endraw %}
```

**Note**: I clearly didn‚Äôt optimize the size. In fact, the images used in the video are from my collection of desktop wallpapers. üôÇ

## Dynamic content?

I didn‚Äôt touch forms and comments: that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt need to automate any dynamic content. I don‚Äôt have forms and even if I‚Äôve been planning to ditch Mailchimp and switch to Freelists or manual newsletters, I can easily add a form using Netlify‚Äôs functionality[^2], as [Silvia did](https://silviamaggidesign.com/newsletter/). I also didn‚Äôt want a comment system in the first place, preferring replies via email and W3C‚Äòs [webmentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention).

## Mobile?

In his analysis, Luke has a detailed chapter about how he [writes on-the-go or on mobile devices](https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2022/04/easier-static-site-publishing/#mobile-and-away-from-home-publishing). Again, I‚Äôm not elaborating because I never find myself in such a situation. Writing posts is not a urgent activity for me, therefore relying on my computer is enough. Had I been forced to, I‚Äôd consider two alternatives:

- Using [micropub](https://micropub.net/) with one of the online clients. I have an endpoint, unwisely untested though.
- Accessing my Github repo and activate [VS Code online](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github).

## Deployment

Since the deployment strategy is git-based I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise to automate this step. I‚Äôve been using either the terminal or [Sublime Merge]({{ site.url }}/uses/#git).

## Future improvements

- Polish the *new post* shell script, for example by switching from `tr` to `sed`.
- I'd love to port the whole process outside macOS, since I'm planning to move dev work to Linux.
- Handle the image resize and optimization within Shortcuts, maybe implementing scripts from [https://css-tricks.com/converting-and-optimizing-images-from-the-command-line/](https://css-tricks.com/converting-and-optimizing-images-from-the-command-line/). I‚Äôve already started tinkering with this, see image below:

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/jekyll-automations-image-optim.png" alt="Shortcuts script for optimizing images" caption="Initial Shortcuts script for optimizing images" width="627" height="650" %}

I will update this post or create a *Part 2* as a follow-up in case I manage to substantially improve the workflow.

## Conclusions

So far this methodology has been serving me well. I didn‚Äôt mind the previous not-so-dynamic workflow, but I appreciate the value of being helped on repetitive tasks. Especially with images: I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be tinkering with the scripts until the whole process is consolidated into one precise action.

One thing I really disliked was Apple forcing me to enable iCloud Drive in order to export Shortcuts‚Äô backups on my machine. I don‚Äôt see the point other than them trying for the umpteenth time to drag me into their walled garden.
