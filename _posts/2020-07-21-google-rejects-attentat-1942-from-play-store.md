    response: "Google is feeling more and more like an overprotective, controlling parent.  WWII is heartbreaking, yes very much so, but important to learn about.  Thanks for sharing."

    response: "Yeah, I don't even fully understand their reasoning, to be honest. The company's due diligence with the German authorities was exceptional. I agree with you about WWII, I have a personal involvement with the event so I can fully relate. Thanks."

Brilliant article by [Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com) about the release of the videogame [Attentat 1942](http://attentat1942.com/). Despite the developer’s effort, Google refused to publish the game on their Play Store in Germany, France, Austria and Russia. I wholeheartedly agree with the company:

> We firmly believe that videogames are art and can be an important part of public conversations. When we ban everything with any controversial keywords no matter the content, everybody loses. [&hellip;] How we’re supposed to make an historically-accurate game about WW2 horrors without Nazis? We don’t know.
