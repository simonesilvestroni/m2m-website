Brilliant article by [Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com) about the release of the video game [_Attentat 1942_](https://attentat1942.com/). Despite the developer’s effort, Google refused to publish the game on their Play Store in Germany, France, Austria and Russia. I wholeheartedly agree with the company:

> We firmly believe that video games are art and can be an important part of public conversations. When we ban everything with any controversial keywords no matter the content, everybody loses. [&hellip;] How we’re supposed to make an historically-accurate game about WW2 horrors without Nazis? We don’t know.
