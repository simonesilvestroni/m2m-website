description: "My point of view about the pros of being outside mainstream social networks for the last 19 months."
---
At the beginning of August 2020 I [deleted all my social media accounts](/blog/escape-from-social-media/), except for YouTube. So, how has it been? I never intended to make a living solely through the music I write: my work in sound design and production is in a different business. Had I read [this post by Steve Lawson](https://www.stevelawson.net/2021/08/keeping-your-soul-in-an-algorithmic-world/) post in 2019, it would have pushed me to consider a few things. 

I don’t judge people that are still juggling with social networks, yet I see any lucubration about how to stay in mainstream social media and save the soul as _plain weird_. I suppose once you’re out you can’t really understand why anyone would want to continue staying locked in — like an ex-smoker. Having lived through the full experience of being engulfed in social networks, I know what Steve’s talking about. However, after leaving pretty much everything in the last couple of years, including Apple's walled garden, I’ve never felt more liberated and light-weight.

## What happened after I left social media

{: .list-hr }
- I suddenly gained what still seems like an insane amount of free time.
- My work has massively improved, becoming more productive and focused.
- I started reading again without interruptions.
- I caught up with things I’d been leaving behind because I didn’t feel like I had the time or the required focus.
- I learned to use Pro Tools, then after a few months [ditched it and learned REAPER](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/).
- I studied Wwise and FMOD (video game audio authoring).
- I expanded my knowledge of new web dev technologies, migrating two websites from WordPress to Jekyll and from a traditional hosting to Netlify, saving money in the process.

Above all, I stopped caring about whatever CEO billionaire do or say, while following savvy people who write about facts, productivity and tech whilst keeping a critical eye on all things related to the so-called “surveillance capitalism”.

## Audience

I can understand the argument about having an _audience_ (though [I dislike the term]({{ site.url }}/blog/de-brand/)), and I get people when they tell me they can’t leave a particular social network because of the relationships they built there. Yet, my escape pushed me to actually speak to the people I used to hang around on those networks. I got in touch, asked for their emails and sometimes their phone numbers.

I now talk to them asynchronously and it feels genuine, real. We have stuff to discuss about, without the usual _oh yeah, I saw it earlier on Facebook_. I nurtured my email newsletter and stayed in touch with a larger amount of people than expected through either email, newsletters, RSS and sometimes Telegram or Signal. Finally, if my contacts came from [Bandcamp](https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/), I followed them there. The vast majority of people who left social media reports the very same conclusions.

## What if?

On the other hand, I can’t understand how people actually enjoy having their time, attention and focus snatched by young-white-male-dominated mega corporations. Especially knowing how they make their money through selling personal data, reprogramming the social behaviour of millions while [altering entire democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hack) in the making. I keep asking: what if these soulless machines stopped working? We all remember the fast demise of MySpace; what would happen to that _audience amplifier_? My answer was, and still is: have your own space [on the internet](https://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html).

  <p><strong>Edit, 10 March 2022</strong>. I re-joined <a href="https://mastodon.help/">Mastodon</a>, as an experiment. I did try it in 2017, to no avail. I now immediately understood why everyone says <em>it's not Twitter</em>. It sure feels like a totally different space.</p>
