**At the beginning of August 2020** I [deleted all my social media accounts](/blog/escape-from-social-media/), except for YouTube. So, how has it been?

I never intended to make a living solely through the music I write: my work in sound design and production is in a different business. Had I read Steve’s post in 2019, it would have pushed me to consider a few things. Today I don’t judge people that are still juggling with social networks, yet I see any lucubration about how to stay in mainstream social media and save the soul as *plain weird*. I suppose once you’re out you can’t really understand why anyone would want to continue staying locked in — like an ex-smoker.

Having lived through the full experience of being engulfed in social networks, I know what Steve’s talking about. However, after leaving pretty much *everything* in the last couple of years — including Apple's walled garden and the post-Brexit UK — **I’ve never felt more liberated** and light-weight.

## Things that happened after I left social media

<ul class="h-feed list-group list-group-flush mt-0 ps-0">
  <li class="list-group-item my-0 ps-0">⏳ I suddenly gained what still seems like an insane amount of free time.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item my-0 ps-0">📈 My work has massively improved, becoming more productive and focused.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item my-0 ps-0">📚 I started reading again without interruptions.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item my-0 ps-0">🏃 I caught up with things I’d been leaving behind because I didn’t feel like I had the time or the required focus.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item my-0 ps-0">🎧 I learned to use Pro Tools, then after a few months I ditched it <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/">and learned REAPER</a>.
</li>
  <li class="list-group-item my-0 ps-0">🎮 I studied Wwise and FMOD (videogame audio authoring).</li>
  <li class="list-group-item my-0 ps-0">👨🏻‍💻 I expanded my knowledge of new web dev technologies, migrating two websites from WordPress to Jekyll and from a traditional hosting to Netlify, saving money in the process.</li>
</ul>

Above all, I stopped knowing whatever CEO billionaire do or say, while I’ve been **following savvy people who write about facts**, productivity and tech whilst keeping a critical eye on all things related to the so-called “surveillance capitalism”.

## Audience

I totally understand the argument about having an audience and an amplifier, and I get people when they tell me they can’t leave a particular social network because of the relationships they built there. My escape **pushed me to actually speak to the people** I used to hung around on those networks. I got in touch, asked for their emails and sometimes their phone numbers.

I now talk to them asynchronously and it feels genuine, real. We have stuff to discuss about, without the usual *oh yeah, I saw it earlier on Facebook*. I nurtured my email newsletter and stayed in touch with a larger amount of people than expected through either email, newsletters, RSS and sometimes Telegram or Signal. Finally, if my contacts came from [Bandcamp](https://music.minutestomidnight.co.uk/), I followed them there. The vast majority of people who left social media reports the very same conclusions.

## What if?

On the other hand, I can’t understand how people can actually enjoy having their time, attention and focus snatched by **young-white-male-dominated** mega corporations. Especially knowing how they make their money through selling personal data, reprogramming the social behavior of millions while [altering entire democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hack) in the making.

Going back to Steve’s article, I keep asking: **what if these soulless machines stopped working**? We all remember the fast demise of MySpace; what would happen to that *audience amplifier*? How would people manage to keep going on as musicians who want to make a living and stay independent? I too remember that tiny window around 2007/2008 where the *web 2.0* seemed such a wonderful promise, only to be snatched and centralized by these awful behemoths that Facebook, Twitter and Google became.

My answer was, and still is: **have your own space** [on the internet](https://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html).

## EDIT: Mastodon

On 10 march I re-joined [Mastodon](https://mastodon.help/), as an experiment. I did try it five years ago, to no avail. I'll be blogging about it in the future, but I immediately understood why everyone says _it's not_ Twitter. It sure feels like a totally different space. 

I've also integrated Mastodon's replies, likes and reboosts in here through [Brid.gy](https://brid.gy/). Check the section [Comments and reactions](#comments) 👇 below.
