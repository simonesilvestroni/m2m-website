Not long ago, I wrote a personal account (in two parts) of what it meant to [release a concept album as an indie artist](/blog/releasing-an-album-as-an-independent-artist-pt1/) in 2019. Specifically talking about the consequences of the music industry move to streaming, I wrote:

> Something that truly bothered me was the fact that Spotify completed the commodification of music in a way that I couldn’t stand. Everyone kept repeating how good of a marketing tool for musicians it was. I could never see that. Spotify don’t tell you who your fans are, don’t allow fans to get in touch with you and surely isn’t interested in making indie music profitable.

> It wasn’t the ridiculous trickle of pennies that the streaming services sent me over the following thirty-eight months, nor the fact that Bandcamp was indeed in a different league (I knew my followers, got messages, reviews, sold CDs and digital albums). It was the obnoxious feeling that corporate social media, and Spotify, weren’t a place where I wanted to be. 

This morning I received an email from <abbr title="Performing Right Society">PRS</abbr> For Music (UK), with the promising jolly subject: _You're being paid royalties today_, followed by an announcement regarding how many millions or British Pounds are being paid out today globally (`161`), and a request to check my statement for more information.

After logging in, I see an unexpected amount of online performances. Since I haven't been playing live or anything, I'm surprised and a little confused. Downloaded the statement, I dig into the numbers, and discover that [a single song](https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/track/sachsenhausen) from my _After 1989_ album in 2019 racked up **1,568,434 streams**. A _million and a half_. Baffling. How could it be? I know I keep neglecting all the streaming stats because I don’t give a damn about it, but I’m sure I should have caught a whiff about it. I suppose it might have been included in some documentary that I don't know anything about.

## Down to the nitty-gritty

The biggest share of those million and a half streams comes from _Alliance YouTube Limited Download / On Demand Streaming Service Video_, divided by the following countries, ordered by number of streams:

- Germany (`999,738`)
- France (`181,979`)
- Netherlands (`127,635`)
- United Kingdom (`93,962`)
- Belgium (`81,729`)
- Sweden (`35,171`)
- Italy (`32,469`)

Besides YouTube, a further chunk — tallying `15,750` — is from _Alliance TikTok Settlement 2014-2020 United Kingdom Limited Download / On Demand Streaming Service_. I don't even remember to have pushed my music onto TikTok (or whatever it was called before), so I checked with CDBaby, and yes, I did.

Checking out the dates in the report, I realise the time period is more than 3 years, from 1 July 2019 to 30 September 2022. The timeframe is a bit weird, since my album was released in November 2019, but I assume it's all due to the fact that I'd been performing [live with Callum Gardner](/blog/live-shows/) around the UK before that (I got some pennies from it as well).

## New car, caviar!

So how much did I get for more than a million and a half streams on YouTube? <mark>46 GBP</mark>. That's around $50, for comparison. I still don't know where all those listens come from, because this is the streaming industry: a commodified bullshit that only care about corporate stakeholders.

Anyway, if you're and independent artist wishing to publish your music online, feel free to go ahead with Spotify, YouTube Music _et al_. Maybe you'll be lucky too, and be able to afford a pizza and a beer for two, 3 years later.
