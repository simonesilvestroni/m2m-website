> Epic Games is excited to announce that The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience is now available to download for free on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.<br><br>
> This boundary-pushing technical demo is an original concept set within the world of Warner Bros' The Matrix.

To achieve this, Epic’s [3Lateral team](https://www.3lateral.com/) captured high-fidelity 3D scans of the actor’s faces and 4D captures of their performances in their Novi Sad studio.

Here's the demo:
