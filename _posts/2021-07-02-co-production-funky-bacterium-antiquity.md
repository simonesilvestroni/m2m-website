> I wrote the music and lyrics and Justine wrangled the melody with great aplomb. Simone Silvestroni helped co-producing the vocal track. He suggested that whomever sang the song, needed to do a Tina Turner on it. That was when I realized it had to be Justine. She knew how to bring it home and I didn't have to give her one ounce of direction.
