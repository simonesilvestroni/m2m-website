excerpt: 'Why Brad Gessler created <em>Legible News</em>, which makes a large size of my daily news intake (the rest being RSS, Hacker News and Mastdodon).'

From Hacker News:

> I created [Legible News](https://legiblenews.com) for news because the internet is full of so much junk and tries to be “real-time” or “breaking” when it’s not necessary. In an effort to make this sustainable, I charge a $9.99 subscription per year (2.7 cents per day) for premium features to pay the hosting bills. I don’t expect to make a fortune from it, but I am hoping to bring in enough revenue to take this idea further and scale it up to more content.
