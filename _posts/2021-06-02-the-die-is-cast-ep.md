## Backstory

When I co-produced and mixed Ember Rev's [second album, _Premonition and Ruin_](/work/music-production/premonition-and-ruin/), a song that I liked didn’t make the final cut. It was a piece divided in two short parts, bookending the album. 

_Land Of Kings_ is my interpretation of that, while [_Papillon_](https://emberrev.bandcamp.com/track/papillon) is my absolute favorite of their entire catalog.

Both lyrics reference the painful process of living in England through Brexit.
