## Backstory

During the initial phase of writing my next album, I had the idea of working on a remix of two songs by Cambridge-based band [Ember Rev](https://emberrev.bandcamp.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. In 2018, together with their songwriter Dan Ecclestone, I worked as a co-producer and mixer for their second album, _Premonition And Ruin_.

At the time, a song didn’t make the final cut. It was a piece divided in two short parts, bookending the album, that I always liked. I remember telling Dan — somewhat jokingly — that I would sooner or later want to use it. _Land Of Kings_ is my interpretation of part 2. [_Papillon_](https://emberrev.bandcamp.com/track/papillon){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is the fourth song in the album, and my absolute favorite of the entire Ember Rev catalog.

Both lyrics referenced the painful process of living in England through Brexit. *The Die Is Cast* is in fact an autobiographical **concept revolving around migration** in Europe, and how deceitful can be to idealize the place where you move to.
