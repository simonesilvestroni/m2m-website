## Platform

In this case, **redesign means overhaul**. While the previous version had been running on WordPress since its debut, I'm now on [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/). Specifically: **Jekyll** as a static site generator and **Netlify** for deployment. All the code, whether dynamic or static, is handwritten by myself. The design has been created together with Silvia Maggi. After a full re-organization of the information architecture I've also refactored most of the content, focusing on newly created **case studies**.

More technical details in the [colophon](/colophon/).

## Philosophy

### Decentralized conversations

The website is now part of [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), therefore it's capable of sending and receiving [webmentions](https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/), a web standard for replying, liking and reposting other people's posts on their websites. Since the decision to **renounce to an external comment system**, I've also added two more ways to reply: _Comment Parade_ allows webmentions from people whose sites aren't part of Indieweb; moreover, it's possible to reply via email. All the info are in the **comments** block near the bottom [ðŸ‘‡](#comments).

### Small web

These decisions are a consequence of me [leaving social media](http://localhost:4000/blog/escape-from-social-media/) 18 months ago. Being part of the [small web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/) is way more in line with how I see the internet and communication in general.

> Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and 'convert'. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.

### Sustainability and performance

The fight against a bloated web is a crusade I've been part of for a long time. See [this digest from Silvia](https://silviamaggidesign.com/design-digested/biased-ai/#webwaste) about the book _Webwaste_. A weight comparison between my previous and current website shows a reduction of <kbd>89.44%</kbd>.

<div class="table-responsive my-5">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr class="table-dark">
        <th scope="col" class="align-top text-center text-uppercase fw-bold">Old site (WordPress)</th>
        <th scope="col" class="align-top text-center text-uppercase fw-bold">New site</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="text-center fs-4"><code>673.5 MB</code> (files)<br>+<br><code>67.2 MB</code> (database)</td>
        <td class="text-center fs-4"><code>70.1 MB</code> (full deployment)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The homepage is now `166 kb` uncompressed and loads in **less than half a second**. I'm in the process of being added to the [512kb club](https://512kb.club/faq).

### Accessibility

Besides being [fully validated](/colophon/#accessibility), the site doesn't have Javascript doing things that can be achieved otherwise. I don't run essential functionality that's exclusively dependent on it. The [search engine](/search/) has an HTML alternative shown directly in the page and the other scripts are doing webmentions and trivial DOM manipulation in the less possible expensive way. The website is fully accessible with Javascript turned off.

### Tracking and surveillance

**I don't use neither cookies nor analytics**, therefore users are not tracked when visiting or commenting this website. Even YouTube videos are served from `https://www.youtube-nocookie.com`.
