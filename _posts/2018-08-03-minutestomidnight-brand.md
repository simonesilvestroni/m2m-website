I didn’t leave [the company I co-founded](http://uifarm.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and co-directed for five years out of some form of frustration. Rather, I wanted also to pursue (once again) my other passion: _music_. Name and logo were my first steps into establishing my brand presence.

## Roots

Last year I started writing and producing a **theatrical concept** called [_After 1989_](/work/original-productions/after-1989/). Besides the music, what I wanted most was to tell a story, both personal and collective. I’ve decided to go down a similar path, establishing a connection between my work activity and my story. It was the foundation for Minutes to Midnight’s name and logo.

I was born during the early 1970s **in Italy**, a country at the forefront of what Churchill called the _iron curtain_. This carried features like having a family who endured World War II, or spending my first two decades in the undeclared conflict that went down to history as _Cold War_. The **fear of a looming military exchange** marked my whole upbringing, to a point when the idea of running to a _fallout shelter_ was considered normal.

## War and peace

The expression _Minutes to midnight_ is a reference to the [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a symbol which represents the likelihood of a human-made global catastrophe since the start of the atomic age. I’ve been writing and reading creative briefs for many years, but when I met with graphic designer Saskia Robertson to discuss my logo, I didn’t have one ready.

Instead, I decided to simply describe the story behind my upcoming album. Saskia read my synopsis, along with other materials I sent over, and came up with _ten different ideas_. They were excellent black and white drafts. Despite their work-in-progress status, I got caught in what seemed a natural choice: keeping the design **achromatic**.

The logo that stood up, and almost immediately seemed apt, was her **re-interpretation of the radiation symbol**. The intriguing way she combined it with the well-known peace glyph ended up being the winning factor. A stencil typeface rendered the logotype, which appealed to my sensitivity to _military symbolism_.

## Consistency

Having sorted name and logo, these were the next steps:

- **Trademarked** name, logo and logotype with the [Intellectual Property Office](https://www.gov.uk/topic/intellectual-property/trade-marks).
- Exported multiple versions of the logo (different media, format, size and colour contrast), depending on the intended destination.
- Chose a set of **typefaces** and extended the brand guidelines to documentation, email, signature etcetera.
- Set a common minimalistic colour palette.
- Chose a set of digital tools that are reliable, easy to use, fast and accessible from anywhere, **no matter what device** is in use.
