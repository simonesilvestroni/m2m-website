The other day I published a [blogroll](/blogroll/) page, like the ones that were ubiquitous in the early 2000s. I'm not entirely sure what caused blogrolls' partial demise: social media follower lists? Not important. 

I'm happy to have added it to the website. Link is in the footer. Most of my entries are either from long-term RSS followings or people I know and admire. I've been happily adding more recent discoveries after I [joined the Fediverse](/blog/note-about-joining-mastodon/).

## New entries

Today I've added two new entries: **Ray Hines** and **Parimal Satyal**. They're both source of inspiration, for totally different reasons. 

Ray's bold life choice of [becoming a nomad](https://alongtheray.com/nomad-life/) reminds me of when my wife and I, 3 years ago, almost ditched everything to live in a narrow boat in Cambridgeshire. Ironically, we've been living a partial nomadic and minimalistic life ever since we left the UK.

Parimal wrote an [essay about the small web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/) that helped me finally reconnecting to my digital roots, when I started coding websites back in 1998. You can find proof of this in a fantastic 'New' animated gif next to the new entries.
