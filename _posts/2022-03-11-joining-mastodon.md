I’ll be blogging about [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@m2m) and the Fediverse in the future, but I immediately understood why everyone says _it’s not Twitter_. It sure feels like a totally different space. I’ve also integrated Mastodon’s replies, favorites and reboosts in the comment section of my blog posts.
