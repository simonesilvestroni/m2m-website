## Production notes

Using a Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 into Reason 8, with no input plug-ins, I tracked Paolo playing his acoustic viola. A small condenser in close proximity, and a figure-8 large condenser to capture the room sound, was all we needed.

I later recorded MIDI parts, using the [Miroslav Philarmonik library](https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/philharmonik2/), and integrated a carefully arranged strings section with Paolo's melodies and textures.

The record also features work by Anna Calvi and Shuta Shinoda. Full [credits on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/release/16808382-Mally-Harpaz-Zoom-In-Zoom-Out).
