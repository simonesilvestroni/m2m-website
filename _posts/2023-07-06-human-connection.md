Ever since I ditched web statistics platforms, I proved to myself that all I really care for is connecting with others, at their pace, in anonymity. For _genuine reasons_.

I signed up to a free [Ahrefs Webmaster Tools](https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools) account, even though I'm not interested in SEO. Apart from checking broken URLs and other fine-tuning, the section that I tend to go back to is _backlinks_. Among the vast amount of scrapers and spam, I've discovered several people who wrote posts inspired by something I'd published. The simple act of seeing strangers quoting a post of mine, or reviewing my music, and doing so from _their personal websites_ instead of some godforsaken comment section, was incredibly uplifting.

## Web 1.0

A few days ago I've found out a few such posts by people I don't know. My reaction was to find a way to get in touch, and message each one of them with a thank you. I really appreciate people who take time off their day to openly look for human connection, so I just did that.

Isn't this what we all used to do before corporations ruined everything on the internet?
