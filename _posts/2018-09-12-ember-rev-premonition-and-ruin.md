## Backstory

Last year I was looking for a lead singer that could convey the story I had written for my upcoming debut album, [_After 1989_](/work/original-productions/after-1989/). One night I stumbled upon a short video on Facebook, posted by Ian Shepherd. It was _Ember Rev_, a folk-rock band playing live at the [Hot Numbers Café](https://hotnumberscoffee.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in Cambridge. The singer and guitarist, **Dan Ecclestone** is a friend of his. I liked what I heard and followed the link to their [Bandcamp page](https://emberrev.bandcamp.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The first song I played caught me off-guard. An intensely powerful and deep male voice, slightly David Bowie-esque at times, with the right amount of gravitas. I immediately thought it was the voice I was after.

## Extended disgruntled ramble

I decided to contact Dan directly. At our first meeting I asked him to be the lead singer — and occasional instrumentalist — for my upcoming album and he enthusiastically agreed. We also discussed his band’s next project, titled _Premonition and Ruin_, and whether I could help with the mixing. An “extended disgruntled ramble about Brexit”, as Dan put it, it was likely to sound more ‘rock’ than their first album. [Ian Shepherd](http://productionadvice.co.uk/about/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was on board as a master engineer.

## Premonition And Ruin

Subtitled “a remainer’s lament for the European ideal”, _Premonition and Ruin_ is an exceptional album, filled with original songs, beautifully written and arranged. Furthermore, I was excited about working with the **accordion**. It doesn’t happen often, and I love the instrument.

When I started mixing the first song, _England’s Finest Hour_, I thought right away of spicing the accordion up, in a &ldquo;Gotan Project&rdquo; sort of style. I worked creatively on the sound and the flow of the delay effect, ending up adding a strange electronic feel to the instrument. Logic’s automation allowed me to achieve a nice fluctuating movement.

## Workflow

I added the project to my Trello boards and enrolled Dan. We both followed the [plan in real time](/work/project-management/) interacting through comments, links and suggestions. We met at least once a week, and the workflow went on in the smoothest possible way. Ian started his involvement with that same first song, using a mix I exported to Dropbox. I used his advice to sort a few EQ problems from the first mix iteration.

## Update: more work

A year later, I ended up producing the band’s follow-up album [_From The Country To The City To The Sea_](https://emberrev.bandcamp.com/album/from-the-country-to-the-city-to-the-sea-2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as well as Dan’s debut solo album [_Hidden Music_](/hidden-music-dan-ecclestone/) in January 2021.
