Founded in 2015, Amuse is dedicated to producing and distributing kids' content across digital platforms.

> Located in the heart of Paris, our team of artists & animators, writers, developers and executives collaborate everyday to produce & distribute great shows throughout the world.

## Initial test

HR contacted me through [SoundLister](https://soundlister.com/portfolio/simone-silvestroni/), explaining the type of job and the fact it would be fully remote. They also sent a 36-seconds long test to be completed for the following week — which I did, successfully.

## Onboarding

For the straightforward process, I signed up for an account on their own online production management platform called _Scale3_, joined their Slack, read a single induction document explaining the procedure from start to delivery, along with a set of specifications and how to file an invoice.

## Project management

The company adopts agile processes to ensure a steady production schedule.

The job started before the pandemic and continued during the first lockdowns in Europe. I interacted with the project manager through Slack. All the episodes of _Car City_ in production were listed in the system, along with features such as state of completion, deadlines and the required documentation.

## Cloud storage

I had access to a cloud storage, where a certain amount of audio libraries created by Amuse were available to download and use. These included all the characters voices, reusable sounds and many car-related effects. While I was bound to use their characters libraries, they let me free to use whatever I wanted for the rest, so I ended up using a mix of both.

## Tasks

I chose to book tasks based on the type of story and the fun I thought I would get from their complexity. The working materials were downloadable from each episode's page: the pre-recorded voice-over in `.wav` format, along with the screenplay and a description of the general requirements.

## Workflow

Once I familiarized with the screenplay and the silent video animation, my go-to actions were:

- Open my template in Logic Pro
- Drag the video into the timeline
- Create markers with the first obvious cues, such as the reusable scenes
- Drag and precisely position audio files for the reusable scenes and the voice-overs, following the screenplay document

Then it was a matter of following the story and create the sound design for the rest of the movie. I kept an iPad as an external monitor, to always have the video on its own.

I didn't use plug-ins except for impulse response reverbs, though I did rely a lot functionalities such as gain, pan, and a whole lot of automation.

## Delivery

Amuse requested the following specifications:

**Audio**

- `.wav`
- Stereo
- 48kHz, 24 bits
- No dithering
- Audio files with voice over (English)
- Audio files without voice over (mute)
- True peak: `–1 dB`
- Loudness integrated target: `–16 dB LUFS` (+/-1 dB margin)
- Dynamic range: `> 9 LU`

**Video**

- `25 fps`
- HDV
- `1280*720p`

Once the mix was finalized and uploaded, the project manager would listen to it and send their feedback. I would receive a message on Slack, along with the possibility of having a discussion or asking for further explanations.

Once all the edits requested in the feedback were completed and a sign-off was obtained, I would proceed to master the audio  and export the video following the guidelines. The task would be marked as complete, usually in less than an hour.

## Release

The episodes were released on YouTube following a specific schedule, usually a couple of weeks after delivery.
