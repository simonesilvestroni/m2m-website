_Skinny Kid_ is the first single from the concept album [_After 1989: A Trip To Freedom_](/music/after-1989/), released 9 November 2019.

## Synopsis

Present-day. Iâ€™m in Berlin. After boarding the S-Bahn 1 to Oranienburg, I relive the decades that followed World War II. A few miles away, the concentration camp where my grandfather was held prisoner by the Nazi. Itâ€™s not easy to try figuring what his ordeal might have been before he managed to escape in the spring of 1945.
