_Skinny Kid_ is the first single from the concept album [_After 1989: A Trip To Freedom_](/work/original-productions/after-1989/), released 9 November 2019.

## Synopsis

Present-day. I’m in Berlin. After boarding the S-Bahn 1 to Oranienburg, I relive the decades that followed World War II. A few miles away, the concentration camp where my grandfather was held prisoner by the Nazi. It’s not easy to try figuring what his ordeal might have been before he managed to escape in the spring of 1945.
