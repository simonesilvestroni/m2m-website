> The philosophy for Antiquity has always been, the right musician and singer for the right song. In this latest album, we decided to move away from singles and concentrate on one singer around a concept album. I wrote the songs and the lyrics and Dan Ecclestone came up with the wonderful melodies and vocals. I’ve read that a lot of people still like listening to whole albums and are drawn to unsigned bands. It’s heartening to know that in this day and age. I wrote the music and lyrics, produced and played on these tunes, and Dan Ecclestone is responsible for the vocals and melody lines and Simone Silvestroni provided the wonderful and ethereal bass lines. Dan and Simone are based in Cambridge UK and I’m based in Brooklyn New York.
