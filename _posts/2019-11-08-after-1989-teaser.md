**Cambridge, 9 November 2019** — Minutes to Midnight's concept album _After 1989: A Trip To Freedom_ is out on the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall.

The album is the story of how a young man escaped Germany in 1945, while his grandson made the other way round, looking for answers that he could only find in 2017.
