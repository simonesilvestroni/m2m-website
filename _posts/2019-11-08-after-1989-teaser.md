**Cambridge, 9 November 2019** â€” My concept album _After 1989: A Trip To Freedom_ is out on the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall. The album is the story of how a young man escaped Germany in 1945, while his grandson made the other way round, looking for answers that he could only find in 2017.
