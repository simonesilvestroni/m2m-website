**Cambridge, 9 November 2019** â€” My concept album _After 1989: A Trip To Freedom_ is out on the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall. The album is the [story of how a young man escaped Germany](https://medium.com/lessons-from-history/a-trip-to-freedom-from-berlin-to-berlin-e9725231eb2e){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in 1945, while his grandson made the other way round, looking for answers that he could only find in 2017.
