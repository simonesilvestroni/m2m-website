description: 'How I refactored my RSS feed from scratch using Jekyll functionalities and applying XSLT for presentation to render a human-readable XML feed.'
excerpt: 'I love <abbr title="RDF Site Summary">RSS</abbr>. However, by using a third-party plugin to automatically generate the feed, I didnâ€™t pay attention to how it could be improved. An occasional discussion on Mastodon prompted me to a change.'

A few days ago, while reading my Mastodon timeline, I stumbled on an [article](https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/04/cool-things-people-do-with-their-blogs/) by Wouter Groeneveld, titled *Cool Things People Do With Their Blogs*. Two things caught my eye: 

- [styled OPML blogrolls](https://rubenerd.com/omake.opml) that can be imported into an RSS reader, by Ruben Schade;
- [styled RSS feeds](http://interconnected.org/home/feed) to better explain what a web feed is, by Matt Webb.

Iâ€™d forgotten about [XSLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT) and its potential applications and what I saw in the above examples were inspiring to me. Also, I kind of ignored how [OPML](http://opml.org/spec2.opml), which Iâ€™ve been using as a format to backup and export/import my RSS feeds, can be styled and used as a human-readable experience on the web.

After a few more clicks, I landed on the OPML [blogroll on Maya's site](https://maya.land/blogroll.opml). As I stated on Mastodon, probably the best and most useful blogroll Iâ€™ve ever seen. Not only they explain why each link might be interesting to anyone visiting, itâ€™s also beautifully formatted and capable of being imported in my RSS reader.

This prompted me to apply styles to my RSS feed and give a human readable format to it. It was surprisingly easy, and I wonder why didn't I do it sooner. Iâ€™ve been using the widespread feed plugin for Jekyll, though since my main motivation for [leaving WordPress]({{ site.url }}/blog/loops-transitions-identity/) was to take full control over my code, I should have managed the feed myself rather than relying on a third party.

## Using Jekyll functionality

Since I wanted to have both blog posts and projects â€” a Jekyll collection â€” I created a loop that would exploit the layout type rather than the content type, iterating 20 times (my configuration value for `posts_limit`) through the resulting variable:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% assign projects = site.documents | where:"layout", "project" %}
{% assign blog = site.documents | where:"layout", "post" %}
{% assign posts = projects | concat: blog | sort: 'date' | reverse %}
  {% for post in posts limit:site.posts_limit %}{% endraw %}
    <item>
      [code here]
    </item>
```

Finally, I created an XSL file to style the feed page into a human readable format, following the aforementioned example by Matt Webb. Since I rewrote the RSS feed from scratch, I also decided to add new features to the `.xsl` file:

- an introduction to who I am at the top of the main feed;
- useful author information directly in each post, for easy contact information;
- a "reply via email" link at the end of each post, visible on any RSS reader.

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/rss-feed-head.png" alt="Author contact info" caption="Author contact info at the top of a post" width="720" height="286" %}

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/rss-feed-footer.png" alt="A reply link at the bottom of each post" caption="A reply link at the bottom of each post" width="720" height="274" %}

The CSS file attached to the XSL presentation is so small that I didn't bother to minify it. The sum of 3 files are less than 5 KB.

## Before & after

Here's a link to my new human-readable [RSS feed]({{ site.url }}/feed.xml). Below, a visual comparison of the before and after.
