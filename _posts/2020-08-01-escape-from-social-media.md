Like plenty others, I’m finally leaving social media, and by that I mean **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **Instagram**, **WhatsApp**, **Pinterest** and **Reddit**. This post is a personal point of view, it’s not intended as an exhaustive analysis on what is going on with social media, nor am I trying to convince anybody.

## Why leave?

### Focus

I’m **redirecting my attention and time** to something more productive and fulfilling. I believe the term _social media_ is an oxymoron. To me, its toxicity has got to a point of no return — not to mention the deliberate addictive mechanisms, their self-declared aim to _hog our time as much as they can_, and the massive problem with [personal data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal). I don’t even want to go down that rabbit hole.

> The thought process was all about: how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible? This means we had to give you a dopamine hit every once in a while.
> 
> <cite>— **Sean Parker**, former _Facebook_ president</cite>

### Hate

The relentless promotion, by every social media company, of **hateful content** such as misogyny, homophobia, racism, and more. The thick nutters peddling debunked conspiracies all day long and getting rewarded for doing that — I’m talking about holocaust deniers, anti-vaccines and other dangerous idiocy. Not to mention the sheer amount of [highly controversial and polarizing material](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/26/yael-eisenstat-facebook-is-ripe-for-manipulation-and-viral-misinformation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

It’s infuriating to the point of leaving me _angry all day long_. I also don’t want to examine the depressing long list of accusations of [altering the course of major elections](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/11/16/564542100/how-disinformation-and-distortions-on-social-media-affected-elections-worldwide){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### Addiction

I used to be an **avid reader and writer**. Over the last ten years, both activities have reduced to a bare minimum. I don’t need to check the mediocre statistics in my Kobo reader: I’m painfully aware of the situation.

The decision of leaving has been brewing for a long while. Because of the release of my concept album last year, I thought I had to ride the social media train for as long as I could. I have no idea about whether or not that was a good idea, the crucial point is how I allowed myself to be _blackmailed into staying put_.

### Behavioral changes

Listen to [Sean Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Parker) (former Facebook president) and [Chamath Palihapitiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya) (former early senior executive at Facebook), a spine-chilling discussion about how Facebook, and by extension social media, was designed to be as addictive as it could, and is now ripping society apart.

## What now?

At the moment, I’m back to the roots. I’m blogging again, while interacting with other writers like I used to do for most of the 2000s. It’s one of many direct ways to establish a connection with friends and strangers alike. When I want to know what other people are up to, I reach out by email or text, I sign up to their newsletter. I’m **having conversations**.

Quite similar to attending a live concert and avoid shooting pointless videos and photos, to simply **enjoy the spectacle**. Imagine watching a sunset without having the urge to take a picture and think about hashtags. Or having a nice meal for the sake of it. You get the gist.

## What about the business?

If anyone is in a similar situation as mine — a professional [working as a freelance](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/) — I’m sorry I don’t have a recipe yet. What I’ve done so far is stop blackmailing myself into **believing that social media is essential to my career**. I’m trying to build stronger relationships in the real world instead. Reach out directly to people. Stop thinking that multinationals handling and centralising all my communications is a good thing. I quit [curating a fake persona](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/learning/are-you-the-same-person-on-social-media-as-you-are-in-real-life.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that has no connection with the real me.

I still don’t know what the lives of my _followers_ really are. What is really going on with them? The point is I’ll never know. I opened up with a few of them, and received enthusiastic reactions. Almost like this is something completely out of the ordinary.

## I'm not going off-grid

The most common reaction I get when I tell people I’m leaving social media is:

> I think I know why you’re doing it. Bold decision, I admire you. I’d do it too if I could.

I don’t think it’s a bold decision at all. On the contrary. Another common motif is that I’m supposedly going to become a hermit. To put things in context: in 2020, `3.96 billion people` — 51% of the entire world population — are using social media (source: [We Are Social](https://wearesocial.com/sg/blog/2020/07/more-than-half-of-the-people-on-earth-now-use-social-media){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}). For the very first time, there are **more people using these tools than do not**. Of course, this doesn’t automatically mean that the whole 51% are _active_ on social media, and the spike is most likely another side effect of COVID-19 and lockdowns. The point is: I find it ridiculous to attach a _hermit_ label to almost 4 billion people. Especially when [I can be found](/contact/) in so many ways.

## Conclusions

Thanks for reading. I’ll probably will post a follow-up in a year or so. Although unlikely, I might end up changing my mind. For now, I’ve been experiencing several **few positive effects** already. I currently am:

<ul class="m2m-ul">
  <li>Reading multiple books at the same time.</li>
  <li>Chewing through my ‘read later’ list like I haven’t done in years.</li>
  <li>Feeling less burdened and way less angry.</li>
  <li>Having deeper conversations with a group of people larger than my usual circle.</li>
  <li>Extremely productive.</li>
</ul>
