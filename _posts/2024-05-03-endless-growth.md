summary: 'Stumbling on a post by an American author that I highly respect reignited my doubts about a dominant growth at all costs culture from the US.'

While expressing my thoughts about [minimalism sold as a product]({{ site.url }}/blog/minimalism-as-a-product/), I indulged on the uncomfortable question if I was biased against the supposed (by myself) American tendency to commodify everything. Back then, the only feedback I got from people living in the US was a passive-aggressive post on Mastodon that ended with a meme, smugly invalidating any opinion about American values that might come from _abroad_.

A few days ago, on one of my favourite blogs [_Life Is Such A Sweet Insanity_](https://blog.jpnearl.com/2024/04/11/fascinating/), a post about travelling on a budget airline contained the following illuminating thought:

> For some reason, the American mindset is endless growth. Everything must get bigger, everything must get better, and more, more, more, how do you like it, how do you like it. But the truth of the matter is, nothing natural undergoes infinite growth, other than some cancers.<cite>J.P. Wing</cite>

J.P. is an amazing writer, and I share an awful lot of his attitude, fully respecting his opinions the rare times when they don't align with mine. He's American. So here I go again: why most of this growth-at-all-costs destructive culture seems to be coming from there?

I've recently decided to stop reading _The Conversation_, after two consecutive posts were openly accusing Europe's investors of not doing enough to be more like Silicon Valley. I'm seriously confused: how can anyone really believe, in 2024, that their business model is anything close to being sustainable? The mental slavery that parts of Europe still seems to be having towards the [rot economy](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/) fuelled by a type of capitalism not integral to the continent is truly bewildering.
