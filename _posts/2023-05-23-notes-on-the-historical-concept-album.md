description: 'Matthew Graybosch reviewed my album ‘After 1989’. I’m honoured and flattered by such a genuine and magnificent analysis.'

I strongly suggest to [check his blog out](https://starbreaker.org), as it's a goldmine of deep, authentic and interesting reflections. Matthew is yet another person that I've found through the decentralised web — which is how the internet was originally built.

When the algorithm is off, the lights come in.

> The first track in particular reminds me of Pink Floyd’s The Wall, though in this album we are not asked to empathize with a self-isolating rock musician who uses drugs to cope with unresolved childhood trauma. Simone Silvestroni plays a mean bass, and unlike many albums his bass and piano don’t get buried in the mix.
> 
> Even if this wasn’t excellent music, I would still recommend it. As the horrors of the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the all-pervading existential terror of the Cold War fade from living memory, it falls to artists to keep that history alive for future generations lest it be repeated.
