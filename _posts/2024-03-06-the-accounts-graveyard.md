After deleting an old WordPress account last week, I opened my Bitwarden password vault to check on the preposterous number of login entries&nbsp;—&nbsp;around 460. Inspired by the [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com), I started a side project: collecting names of major corporations that I've had an account with for years, and that I want to rid of.

Not going to list _all_ the two hundreds and fifty accounts that I've erased, nor complain about the [bizantine](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/byzantine) manoeuvres put in place by corporations in order to prevent people from leaving — that's their problem. Far from being yet another frustrated post on the growth-at-all-costs culture of the capitalistic internet, I want to briefly analyse a few deletions, and why they helped me feeling lighter and quieter.

## Music

Nobody have ever reached out by saying they were interested in knowing more, after finding my music on _Spotify_. Since this is by design, I removed all the music and deleted both my personal and artist accounts. Same as with [_SoundCloud_]({{ site.url }}/blog/leaving-soundcloud/), it feels pointless to scatter songs over centralised online silos. The sanest direction of travel from now on is to follow the principles of [#BeYourOwnPlatform](https://beyourownplatform.site).

## The large ones

I stopped ruminating over my past participation with large conglomerates. I'm just glad that now I don't get noise from _Facebook_, _Instagram_, _Twitter_, _Reddit_, _Medium_, _Microsoft_, and _Adobe_. Happy about not spreading _Mailchimp_ tracking codes into people's inboxes, I've never went anywhere near _Substack_ either. Once I manage to refurbish my Android phone with an independent _Google_-free ROM, I'm also gonna axe the ex-search-now-ads giant.

## Automattic

Four years ago, when I decided to leave WordPress, I didn't do it in spite of any company shenanigans: I simply didn't enjoy the software anymore. While it's true that I've never liked its CEO and co-founder, the recent pile-up of multiple controversies pushed me to delete accounts with _wordpress.com_, _wordpress.org_, _PocketCast_, and consequently the now useless _WP Rocket_ and _Yoast_. _Tumblr_ had been in the graveyard for some time.

## VC-funded vultures

Cut ties with _Uber_, _Netlify_, _AirBnB_, _Cloudflare_, _Zapier_, and many more.

## The pointless ones

Whether because they don't make sense to me anymore, or due to some enlightened management decision to follow the AI [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem), I quit holding hands with _Mozilla_, _Deviantart_, _Stack Overflow_, _Atlassian_, _Trello_, _Discord_, _Eventbrite_, _Meetup_, _Figma_, _Klarna_, _Patreon_, _Vimeo_, _WeTransfer_.

## Final thoughts

The above amounts to a tiny percentage of the culling. A sheer number of deletions are confined in the extremely fragmented world of sound design. Every single audio plug-in depends on an inefficient online account, whether the software is paid or free, so I moved away from that world a while ago, to consolidate my efforts around a few tiny (and one big) companies.

A heartfelt mention of honour goes to _Avid_. The privacy request I sent on 4 December 2023 through their official privacy channel still has to be processed. Two months later I asked what the wait was for, so they assigned a request ID to my reply, answering after a week by saying "This is a duplicate question about a previous request". I'll wait.
