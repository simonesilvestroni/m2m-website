It's been three years since I rejected the morally corrupt, privacy-invading, time (and energy) waster that is corporate social media, and it works. Besides email, chats on either <abbr title="Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol">XMPP</abbr> or Telegram, and a couple of audio-related forums, I only interact online on [Mastodon](https://sonomu.club/@m2m). A decentralised social media, part of a larger interconnected network called [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), it's independent and open source. Designed to be small, it can't be owned by a single entity. Its ethos is one of inclusion, also reflected by tools that favours accessibility, and a fine tuning of the strictly chronological timeline through detailed filters. The fediverse currently [suits me well]({{ site.url }}/blog/enjoy-the-difference/). My approach to Mastodon has consolidated to these practices:

{: .list-hr }
- Checking out anyone who follows me, using a few criteria on what constitutes a potentially interesting person. It's often empirical.
- Following (or following back) people who actively interact with others, generally post interesting things, seem empathetic, and are _not a brand_. If there's no authenticity, I see no point. Broadcasting a successful _online persona_ is not being social.
- Limiting 99% of my posts to pure text and links, which lowers the load on the electric grid.
- _Always_ providing an alternative text to images, for accessibility.
- Not using a Mastodon app on my mobile phone, just the website in Firefox. 
- Not enabling notifications. 
- Disabling boosts, only occasionally checking them out.
- Strictly avoiding the federated timeline.
- Enabling internal notifications (the "bell") for new posts by a super short list of people that I deeply care about, so I don't miss on what they write.

I'm often adjusting my follow-followers ratio, based on an ever-changing perception of other people. Unfortunately, vetting is something that needs to be done every now and then. I [seriously don't care about numbers](https://web.archive.org/web/20231223023152/https://alirezahayati.com/2023/08/21/bugs-of-social-networks/), however I tend to quickly spot the borderline-broadcasters, or borderline-brands. Usually, I wait for a few weeks or months to see if they jump the shark, before unfollowing.

Pretty much all other social networks have nothing to do with _social_, thus don't interest me. While it's true that I still have a YouTube account, I've been using it like a TV in the 1990s, only [via RSS and Pocket]({{ site.url }}/blog/how-i-read-online/). Focusing on fewer asynchronous and authentic interactions, and removing the obsessive checking, uploading, replying that's been the norm since the early 2000s, I achieved [some needed degrowth](https://theconversation.com/the-internet-consumes-extraordinary-amounts-of-energy-heres-how-we-can-make-it-more-sustainable-160639).
