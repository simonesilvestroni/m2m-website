## Japan, 75 years ago

**6 August 1945** â€” At 8:15 am (Hiroshima time) an atomic bomb called _Little Boy_, the first ever to be dropped on a populated city, took less than 50 seconds to fall from the _Enola Gay_ to the city. The _B-29_ stayed over the target area for two minutes and was ten miles away when the bomb detonated.

## Germany, 75 years ago

**April, same year** â€” Two men escape from a concentration camp called [Sachsenhausen](https://www.sachsenhausen-sbg.de/en/), built in the town of Oranienburg, north of Berlin. One of them, who had spent four years there, **was my grandfather**.

Now a fugitive, heâ€™s running away from imprisonment with a fellow Soviet inmate. They have to steal from German citizens, for food, protection and to go unnoticed during the day. They tie themselves to tree branches at night. The skinny kid came back home, mostly walking, [from Berlin to Italy](/blog/after-1989-full-story/).

## A glimpse of something

_A Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgot On A B-29_ is the second song from the concept album _After 1989: A Trip To Freedom_. It plays around the two events. A glimpse of hope for the two tired men running away in Central Europe, a horrific wasteland in Japan. The nuclear era was born.

## Song backstory

The title is a pun over an [old tune by Vera Lynn](https://youtu.be/4Zj-XYQ21qE) â€” also played at the beginning of the film _Pink Floyd The Wall_ by Alan Parker â€” intertwined with the name of the atomic bomb and the plane that dropped it. Since the song is about two fugitives running away from a concentration camp, I wanted to convey a feeling of cautious optimism at the beginning. Trumanâ€™s speech announcing the event, while wrongly acknowledging **Hiroshima as â€˜a military baseâ€™**, introduces the world to the horrors of the nuclear era.

The contrast between the Christmas carol-like music of the final section, and this flatly delivered horrifying declaration is chilling.

## Song demo

Here is the demo of the song, at the time **entirely played by Paolo Clementi** with the acoustic viola. We recorded dozen of tracks, while he played the solo on top of these layers. Both the solo and the final viola riff made it to the final version.
