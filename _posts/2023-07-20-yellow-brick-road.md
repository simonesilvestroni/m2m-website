description: 'A transparent and honest analysis on the struggle to go back to a job that I left.'

This is not my first foray into the unintended consequences of a past decision that's affecting my present. I'm not again onto why I left the UK to "temporarily stay in Italy" until COVID is over&nbsp;—&nbsp;I'm thinking of a specific chain of events caused by a life choice from several years ago.

I take pride in considering myself a digital polymath. I know it’s not a rare occurrence in modern life&nbsp;—&nbsp;it doesn’t take a savant to become one these days&nbsp;—&nbsp;yet, I’ve always put a lot of effort trying to excel in my eclectic interests. I fuelled career leaps (music, video games sound design, with print design and web development as intermittent side hustles) by channelling the pleasure of _feeling proficient_ in something that I enjoy doing.

I spent decades fighting tooth and nail against whomever labelled me a _jack of all trades, master of none_. The fact that&nbsp;—&nbsp;besides my encyclopedic knowledge of Pink Floyd, or a quirky talent in recognising typefaces by just looking at them&nbsp;—&nbsp;I struggle to consider myself a _proper expert_ feels problematic at this moment in life. I like [not being alone in this](https://kevquirk.com/the-expert-vs-the-impostor) though.

Leaping from one career to the next, while helping build personality and bring a wider range of high level experiences, had one slighlty unsavoury consequence. I've always needed to counterbalance creative activities with something deeply technical. To function at my best, I need both freedom of expression and a solid set of rules&nbsp;—&nbsp;something that's not easy to find within a single gig. Except for the one that I'd decided to leave in 2006: video games.

I've been ruminating for days on what could have been, had I not left. It's a job that entails what I love the most: sound, storytelling, intelligent escapism, positive stimuli, exciting technical challenges, problem solving. I actually pioneered _modern_ game audio&nbsp;—&nbsp;at least in my more or less backward home country&nbsp;—&nbsp;juggling team leader duties with intense audio work. I learned the process of integrating an adaptive soundtrack within a custom in-house 3D engine, in 2001. I created sound effects using field recording and libraries, implementing them in rudimental audio middleware, whether that be the in-house editor or the first Xbox and PlayStation 2 <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr>s. Optimise sounds within the reach of each platform limitations was no joke. All the while dealing with meetings, and managing a team in a dysfunctional work environment. No webinars back then: only thick printed manuals, and the annual Game Developer Conference.

Of course, that caused burnout, and a desire to leave. Understandable, but naive. I could have had _two decades of major experience_ in the field, which would have likely meant being able to work anywhere I wanted. Instead of basking in the glory of being present on the day that Valve unveiled Steam at the 2002 GDC, I now could have been _teaching_ Audiokinetic Wwise instead of learning it.

I guess it all boils down to this: while I might be struggling to go back to game audio after such a hiatus, my plan B as a web developer is not ironclad. With my dislike of Javascript and the current trend of bloated websites, I could be [edging irrelevancy](https://helloyes.dev/blog/2022/mourning-my-obsolete-skillset/). Similarly, I should promote the shit out of my music producer skills in a terribly saturated sector, where the path to succeed is intertwined with an uncanny ability to be a noisy and relentless social media marketing brand machine — something that I really cannot and [don't want to be]({{ site.url }}/blog/de-brand/). If I'm being honest, I'd rather devote my music producer capacity to side projects.
