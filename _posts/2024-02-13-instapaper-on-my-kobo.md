Erasing my Pocket account a few weeks ago was an easy choice. Ever since Mozilla morphed it into yet another algorithmic-based attention seeker, I couldn't stand the product. Went straight back to [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) â€” a mature, simple, elegant reading application that's not trying to force unsolicited crap onto me.

What's this got to do with my Kobo? As it happens, [Pocket is integrated in its operating system](https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017763753-Use-the-Pocket-App-with-your-Kobo-eReader), so every time I saved an article for later, it showed up on the ereader. Reading articles and posts on such a device is a much better experience compared to a phone or a laptop. It was _convenient_.

Today I discovered that Instapaper has a download function which includes epub among the formats: it's fast and looks amazing. Sure, it needs to be copied to the Kobo via a USB cable, but if the goal was to be able to read my articles offline in a beautiful stripped down format on a relaxing device, I call it a complete success.
