summary: 'On the 60th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination, Todd Gardner featured my song in a special episode of his podcast.'

> Ten years ago as the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination was approaching, I asked garage/psychedelic bands if they would contribute a track to a Creative Commons compilation I put together called Conspiracy A-Go-Go. Several bands recorded new tracks specifically for that compilation, while other bands contributed tracks that they had already released. The original Conspiracy A-Go-Go compilation was released November 1, 2013, and is available as a [free download on Bandcamp](https://turnmeondeadman.bandcamp.com/album/conspiracy-a-go-go), the Free Music Archive and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/Conspiracy_A-Go-Go-15396). This episode of Turn Me On, Dead Man picks up where the 2013 compilation left off.<br>

> I don’t think it’s possible to maintain a truly comprehensive list. My approach, then, has become to gather tracks that stand out in some way. The playlist for this episode contains 26 tracks released in the last decade that are all worthy of note.<br>

> A couple of the tracks in the playlist look at events outside of the assassination itself. Minutes to Midnight focuses on the warm reception JFK and Jackie Kennedy received when they landed at Love Field in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Contrasted with the exuberant reception the Kennedys received on a beautiful fall day, the tone of the music anticipates the tragedy that is about to unfold.
