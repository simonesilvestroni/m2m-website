## Why offer audio archival to clients?

I believe audio archiving is a nice-to-have additional feature to offer to clients. Think about **future potential re-mixing or re-mastering**, for instance. Audio stems from each session can be carefully filed to multiple sources, to guarantee the **preservation of the material** for years to come. Please note that I don’t offer _full sessions archives_, as that’s unrealistic.

## Perfecting the backup strategy

I’m constantly perfecting my backup and archive strategy, which includes both my work and personal data, and clients’. I rely on a proven [3-2-1 technique](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}: three copies of everything at all times, two local and one off-site. Specifically:

<ul class="m2m-ul">
  <li>💽 Two sets of redundant RAID drives running daily backups on both OSes.</li>
  <li>☁️ <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html#af9rjz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backblaze</a> remote cloud backup.</li>
</ul>

For extra-redundancy and out of an abundance of precaution, I also run:

<ul class="m2m-ul">
  <li>A Time Machine drive with the default hourly setup for macOS.</li>
  <li>A clone of my production SSD external drives on both OSes, so that I can be <em>instantly up and running</em> in case of malfunction.</li>
  <li>A <strong>bootable clone</strong> of my entire internal drive, for both OSes.</li>
</ul>
