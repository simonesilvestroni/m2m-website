## Why offer audio archival to clients?

I believe audio archiving is a nice-to-have additional feature to offer to people I work for. Think about future potential re-mixing or re-mastering, for instance. Audio stems from each session can be carefully filed to multiple sources, to guarantee the preservation of the material for years to come. I'm not talking about _full sessions archives_, as that’s unrealistic.

## Perfecting the backup strategy

I’m constantly perfecting my backup and archive strategy, mostly relying on a proven [3-2-1 technique](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/): three copies of everything at all times, two local and one off-site. Specifically:

- One set of RAID drives running daily backups
- One set to be kept off-site in a different location

For extra-redundancy and out of an abundance of precaution, I also run:

- A single external bootable SSD which perfectly clones the entire Mac HD
- Time Machine on macOS for further redundancy

I used to backup audio sessions on DVDr too, however I stopped doing so a while ago.
