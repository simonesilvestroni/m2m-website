Like the previous singles, [_Hang Loose_](/work/music-production/hang-loose-callum-gardner-song-production/) and [_Wriggle A Little_](/work/music-production/wriggle-a-little-song-production/), I recorded and produced the single, along with playing my Fender Jazz [fretless bass](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/206552-simone-silvestroni).
