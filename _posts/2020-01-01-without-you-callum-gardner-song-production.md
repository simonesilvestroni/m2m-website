Like the previous singles, [_Hang Loose_](/blog/hang-loose-callum-gardner-song-production/) and [_Wriggle A Little_]({{ site.url }}/blog/callum-gardner-wriggle-a-little/), I recorded and produced the single using Logic Pro, along with playing my Fender Jazz [fretless bass](https://soundbetter.com/profiles/206552-simone-silvestroni).
