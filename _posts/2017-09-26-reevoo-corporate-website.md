## Objectives

The client wanted both their corporate website and the blog to be redesigned following strict guidelines. The main site needed a responsive live demo application to showcase their product, and a tight integration with Salesforce.

## Approach

We developed two multi-language bespoke WordPress websites, which included the live demo web app. It shown potential clients how user generated content such as reviews, ratings and conversation could be delivered and embedded on their web products. As with other similar tasks during my years at UI Farm, I was responsible for the front-end look & feel, a few intricated modules such as a responsive HTML/CSS only carousel with tabbed interface, web performance, continuous deployment, along with shared project management.

## Results

The website featured integrations with Salesforce for lead generation, and LinkedIn for authentication. The live demo was a stunning success. Despite an heavy usage of images and background videos, we managed to achieve a remarkably great performance. Reevoo kept my company on a retainer for years to follow.

## Client endorsement

> I had the pleasure of working with UI Farm, as we re-built our corporate website using WordPress while making it responsive. From the very get go, UI Farm were extremely professional and proactive with the build process and worked with us closely as requirements evolved. This ability to adapt changes in an agile manner is a key aspect that differentiates them from other firms. The new website was launched on time and was perfect on all devices, all in all testament to a job well done.
