It feels like a distant memory. Almost unreal, like it never really happened. Hard to put in words how unimportant that colossal waste of time and energy was.

I'm going to celebrate the forgotten anniversary by collecting my thoughts, and deciding to be more direct, more personal. Reflect more about music, life, daily activities, some glimpse of hope for the future.
