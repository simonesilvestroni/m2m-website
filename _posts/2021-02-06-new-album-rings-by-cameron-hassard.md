description: "The debut album from Berlin-based recording artist and multi-instrumentalist Cameron Hassard."

Saturday, time for some new music. I’ve been following the online magazine Indierepublik (formerly <em>Indie Berlin</em>) for a while now, way before they wrote a [really good review for _After 1989_]({{ site.url }}/work/music/after-1989/#reviews).

They caught my attention with an [article they published](https://indierepublik.com/music/cameron-hassard-releases-his-debut-mini-album-rings-and-it-packs-a-punch/) a couple of days ago, a review for the new album by Cameron Hassard, titled _Rings_.

The promise of an album presenting itself like a movie, narrated by an artist that sounds a bit like Mark Lanegan, was alluring enough. So I went, and what a surprise. This is a great finding — treat yourself with this gem of an album:

_Rings_ was produced and recorded at Berlin’s [Famous Gold Watch Records](https://thefamousgoldwatch.com/) by Cameron James Laing (Universal).
