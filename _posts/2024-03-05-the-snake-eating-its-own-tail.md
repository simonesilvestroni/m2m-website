description: 'There once was a serpent who only traveled in one direction, always forward, never backward. Until one day, the serpent came upon a demon. The demon cursed the serpent, driving him insane, causing him to eat his own tail.'

For a while I've been mulling over a distinct feeling, the sudden realisation that I've been dwelling in too much negativity. Not sure for how long it's been going on, but I'm certain of the loop it generates: like an [ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros), while absorbing gloominess elsewhere, I've been contributing with my own feelings of deep despondency.

I see human affairs kindly showing what we're capable of, on a daily basis, however, no one needs to constantly keep soaking in fury, frustration, and generalised pessimism. After the decision to stay away from mainstream news, and delete all corporate social media, why am I still so attached to this Orwellian need to vent my two minutes of hate on a daily basis? Whether it's me or Mastodon&nbsp;—&nbsp;or better, the act of being exposed to a mostly pessimistic barrage of short statements from all over the world&nbsp;—&nbsp;it's a cycle that I'm going to break.
