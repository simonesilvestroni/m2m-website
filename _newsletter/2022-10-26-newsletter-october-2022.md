As things are still moving at a slow pace, I have a few updates, both personal and work-related.

## Moving again 🇬🇧

Sometime in 2023 **I’ll be moving back to the UK**. It’s not a decision taken on a whim, and despite being initially driven by tax reasons, I have to admit a timid build-up of excitement. The hope is to spend a few more years in the country and being able to witness a positive change from the decade-long conservative regime.

## Music I worked on

The debut EP by Italian band **Arva Vacua**, *Tales from holographic seas*, is officially out now. Based in my hometown Ravenna, they range between cinematic suggestions and an indie-rock feeling, shifting the perspective of a diverse music background.

I mixed the song [*Nebbia (part one)*](https://arvavacua.bandcamp.com/track/nebbia-part-one).

Also, together with Emilio Albertoni, I've mastered the song _I'm waiting (Imagine)_ by the Italian artist **AGA**.

I have worked for several clients over the last couple of months. The material is still unreleased, so I’ll send links as soon as they’re available:

- Mastered an EP for an Italian duo.
- Mastered the soundtrack for a brilliant documentary between the UK and Italy.
- Mixing a new album for a Cambridge-based band (work in progress).

## Minutes to Midnight 🎵

With upcoming new material, the moniker will be reserved to original music only. I recently bought my personal web domain, which will be the destination of all the work-related pages and blog currently present on minutestomidnight.co.uk.

## Game audio progress 🎮

Closing in on my long process of updating my game audio skills, after missing from the industry for seventeen years. Current status: completing the 251 course of Wwise and planning the show reel.

Until next time.
