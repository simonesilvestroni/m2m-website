I published the first article of a 3-part series about how and why I switched from Pro Tools to REAPER.

In the first instalment, I focused on the first three benefits (out of 8) that I’ve experienced:

- Cost
- Multi-platform software
- A new workflow, based around the user

The next episode will go online on the 4th of April.
