Today I released two new songs on Bandcamp. It’s a little preview for my next concept album, titled _The Die is Cast_.

Both songs are remixes of Cambridge-based band Ember Rev. I’ve been working with them as a mixer, and sometimes co-producer, for years. Originally written by Dan Ecclestone, they encapsulate some of my feelings about the painful process of living in the UK through Brexit.
