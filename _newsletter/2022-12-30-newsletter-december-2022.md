## I split my website in two

I finally ended the ambiguity of my dual skillset, dividing my website in two: the first half is still Minutes to Midnight, which now contains sound and music material; the second half is related to my tech and web development side and lives in a [new domain by my name](https://simonesilvestroni.com).

This newsletter stays under Minutes to Midnight as it’s always been and won’t change its nature: still about audio, music and (soon) video games.

## New line-up for Minutes to Midnight

Speaking about music, Minutes to Midnight just became a duo, after the multi-instrumentalist and producer Emilio Albertoni and I joined forces.

All the info can be found in the rewritten [about page](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/about/).

Our projects for 2023 are Emilio’s debut album and Minutes to Midnight’s follow-up concept to the successful *After 1989: A Trip to Freedom*.

After producing the single [*Non sai chi sono*](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/work/music/non-sai-chi-sono/) together, Emilio and I have been working on a few projects, including [Arva Vacua’s debut EP](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/arva-vacua-debut-ep/) and the upcoming EP for the band IsadoraD.

Happy new year.\
Simone
