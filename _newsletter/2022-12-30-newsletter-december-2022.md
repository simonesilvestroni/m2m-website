Instead of a yearly wrap up, I’m going to keep it simple.

I finally ended the ambiguity of my dual skillset, dividing my website in two: the first half is still Minutes to Midnight, which now contains sound and music material; the second half is related to my tech and web development side and lives in a [new domain by my name](https://simonesilvestroni.com).

This newsletter stays under Minutes to Midnight as it’s always been and won’t change its nature: still about audio, music and (soon) video games.

Happy new year.<br>
Simone
