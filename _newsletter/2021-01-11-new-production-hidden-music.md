_Hidden Music_ is made of 6 songs, written for piano and vocals, where the delicate sound of strings and organ mix with the strength of drums and double bass.

Iâ€™ve mixed the album, recorded by [**Sound On Sound**&nbsp;â†—ï¸Ž](https://www.soundonsound.com/) director Sam Inglis and mastered by Ian Shepherd, co-author of [**Loudness Penalty**&nbsp;â†—ï¸Ž](https://www.loudnesspenalty.com/).
