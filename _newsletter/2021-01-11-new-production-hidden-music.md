The new solo album _Hidden Music_ by Dan Ecclestone, songwriter and leader of the Cambrdige-based band Ember Rev, is out now.

It's made of six songs, written for piano and vocals, where the delicate sound of strings and organ mix with the strength of drums and double bass.

I’ve mixed the album, recorded by [Sound On Sound&nbsp;↗︎](https://www.soundonsound.com/) director Sam Inglis and mastered by Ian Shepherd, co-author of [Loudness Penalty&nbsp;↗︎](https://www.loudnesspenalty.com/).
