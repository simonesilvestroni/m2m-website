## New website

Over the last few weeks I completely refactored [my website](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk). After a drastic reduction in size and the complete elimination of bloated frameworks such as Bootstrap, it's even more focused on sustainability, the concept of small web and its connections with the Indieweb and the Fediverse. Details in the new [credits](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/credits/) page.

## I mixed the new album by Ember Rev

Once again, I exploited the subproject functionality in REAPER to save time and  processing power while [mixing a rework of Ember Rev’s debut album](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/mix-ember-rev-reaper-subprojects/). After having mixed *Premonition and Ruin* and *From The Country To The City To The Sea*, it was a brilliant opportunity to have my signature mix on their first trilogy.

## New reviews for ‘After 1989’

My debut concept album has been receiving a [newfound wave of attention](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/new-reviews-after-1989/) recently, especially after I stopped trying to sell it. I’m very thankful for the lovely feedback, especially for a 4-year-old album.

## My experience releasing an album as an independent artist

The unexpected new interest towards *After 1989* inspired me to write a 2-part blog post, where I expressed the feelings I've experienced before, during and after its release.

[Part 1](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/releasing-an-album-as-an-independent-artist-pt1/) is about what the album meant to me and a few considerations about what a successful release is and isn’t.

[Part 2](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/releasing-an-album-as-an-independent-artist-pt2/) is about the type of release campaign, how we approached the concept of social media marketing, why it failed and what changed in the  aftermath.

## The Waves debacle

Waves Audio Ltd [announced a sudden switch to a subscription-only model](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/waves-switched-to-subscription-and-people-are-angry/), only to U-turn a few days later following a massive backlash. It was fun to watch a well-established corporation lose its reputation in the matter of hours.
