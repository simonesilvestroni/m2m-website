I completed my 3-part series about how and why I switched from Pro Tools to REAPER. You can fine the 3 articles here:

- [**Part 1**: a new workflow and a sensible business model](/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/).
- [**Part 2**: complete customization and the value of community](/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-2/).
- [**Part 3**: fast development cycle and a massive efficiency improvement](/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-3/).

Finally, I just pushed online a link, with my brief reaction about the magnificent interview to Susan Rogers on [Pensadoâ€™s Place](https://youtu.be/AJExXyVSdUs?t=187).
