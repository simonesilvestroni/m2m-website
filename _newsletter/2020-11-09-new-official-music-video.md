I released today a new music video for the song _The Logic_, on the anniversary of my debut album _After 1989_.

The single depicts the starting point of that symbol of division, the dark days of August 1961 when Berlin was cut in half. It’s also my homage to a brother, Michele, who played the drums in the song. I lost him around the same time, almost twenty years ago.
