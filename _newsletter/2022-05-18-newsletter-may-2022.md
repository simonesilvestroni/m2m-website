excerpt: 'I’ve been working hard on my <strong>web design skills</strong> lately. Learned several new things, which I then applied to my website and promoted on my Mastodon account. I have <strong>recorded bass tracks</strong> on a couple new songs and re-published an <strong>EP on Spotify</strong>.'

I’ve also **ditched Mailchimp** completely, hence this email isn’t coming from there: no more tracking, no more external privacy policies. You can also follow new issues with an RSS reader; all the Instructions for changing your address or unsubscribing are in the signature.

The newsletter is also changing format: inspired by **Silvia** and her [*Design, Digested*](https://silviamaggidesign.com/newsletter/) I’m going to share two or three links from my various activities plus a couple more from elsewhere that I think are interesting.

## 👋 News from my website, May 2022

### [Life after social networks and joining Mastodon](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/life-after-social-networks/)

My point of view about the pros of being outside mainstream social networks for the last 19 months, and joining the Fediverse.

### [‘The Die is Cast’ on Spotify](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/the-die-is-cast-on-spotify/)

My EP *The Die Is Cast*, produced with Antiquity and published last year on Bandcamp, is now also on Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube Music.

### [A human-readable RSS feed with Jekyll](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/build-a-human-readable-rss-with-jekyll/)

I love RSS. However, by using a third-party plugin to automatically generate the feed, I didn’t pay attention to how it could be improved. An occasional discussion on Mastodon prompted me to a change.

## 🎵 Music I liked

I bought on Bandcamp a 2019 album by [**Chelsea Jade, _Personal Best_**](https://chelseajade.bandcamp.com/album/personal-best). I find this kind of well-produced sophisticated pop attractive and relaxing. While I’m usually not into pop, I like to keep an eye on the genre, always keen to broad my music interests.

## 🤝 People I met online

Every since I joined Mastodon, I met quite a few interesting people, more than I initially expected. Today I’d like to link to [**Raymond Hines’ blog**](https://alongtheray.com/). Ray is a lifelong entrepreneur who began a nomadic life on the road in 2016. He’s been living in a tiny camper ever since.
