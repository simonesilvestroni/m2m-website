I finally published my brand new website. Leaving the WordPress ecosystem felt good: a massive change with consequences over many aspect of my online presence.

Briefly:

- migrating to the static site generator Jekyll and deploying to Netlify set me free from my hosting provider, saving me money.
- as everything is now built from scratch by myself, I have full control over code, images and the whole process of publishing my material.
- getting rid of the cumbersome and vulnerable server-side mechanism behind a database-driven system such as WordPress, meant reducing my files weight by an incredible 89%.
- the website is fully accessible from all devices.
- it runs on renewable energy servers and its light weight and absence of third-party scripts contribute to make it fully sustainable as well.
- The content has also been reorganized. I now embrace both my skills: audio and web design. A new work page is centered around case studies.
