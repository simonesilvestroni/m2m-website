Today I released another new song on Bandcamp. Included in the new EP _Aperture_, _Non sai chi sono_ is the remix of an original song by Italian artist and producer Nevica, aka Gianluca Lo Presti.

Read all about the new song, produced and arranged by Emilio Albertoni and myself, and get the link to a free download in the [project analysis]({{ site.url }}/work/music/non-sai-chi-sono/).
