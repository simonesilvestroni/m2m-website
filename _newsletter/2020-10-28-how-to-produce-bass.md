[The article](https://unlockyoursound.com/producing-bass-tracks-remotely/), published by London-based Unlock Your Sound, is based on a real-life example: recording, mixing and delivering the bass track for the song _The Far Side Of The Sun_ by Gerald Duchene.

In the same article, you can find a link to download my free ebook [‘Efficient Productivity for Music Professionals’]({{ site.url }}/work/project-management/). I wrote this essay using my years of knowledge as a freelance worker in the music field, both as sound designer and producer, in the UK and elsewhere.
