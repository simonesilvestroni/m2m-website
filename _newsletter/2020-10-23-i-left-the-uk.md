Over the last couple of months I left the UK and came back to Italy. If you’re interested in the reasons why I chose so, here’s a [short blog post](https://simonesilvestroni.com/blog/back-to-the-future-leaving-the-uk).

In the meantime, I wrote a new article about recording and producing bass tracks remotely, which will be published next week on my friend Chris' website, [Unlock Your Sound](https://unlockyoursound.com). If you're into optimizing your workflow, the article contains a nice link to a free ebook that I put together!

Lastly, after re-settling in my hometown of Ravenna, I co-produced a new song with local multi-instrumentalist Emilio Albertoni. I really love this song, and can't wait to release it.

Speak soon.
