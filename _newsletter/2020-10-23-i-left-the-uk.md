In the meantime, I wrote a new article about recording and producing bass tracks remotely, which will be published next week on my friend Chris' website, [Unlock Your Sound&nbsp;↗︎](https://unlockyoursound.com). If you're into optimizing your workflow, the article contains a nice link to a free ebook that I put together!

Lastly, after re-settling in my hometown of Ravenna, I co-produced a new song with local multi-instrumentalist Emilio Albertoni. I really love this song, and can't wait to release it.

Speak soon.
