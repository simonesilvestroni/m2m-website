_Berlin 91_ is actually the first video I worked on, two years ago. In a suggestive room in Copenhagen, I spent a few hours editing footage shot by Derek Williams in 1990 (thanks Derek!). The genuine approach, along with the fact his images perfectly reflected my memories of Berlin in those days, convinced me.

My work on the video surely is naive and unpolished, but shows a first approach. I wanted that to be raw, on purpose. Watch the video:
