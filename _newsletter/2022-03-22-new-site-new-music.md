On the music side:

- I’ve been recording new bass tracks for Antiquity. They’ll be soon on Bandcamp.
- I’ve started working on my next album. The concept is about migration in Europe and it should be made of 5 songs, likely two in Italian — bookending the album — and three in English.

The new album, tentatively titled _Crossing The Rubicon_, will be produced by myself, with a very compact line-up. I will be working with two sets of people, one per language. For the English section I’ll be joined by multi-instrumentalist **Gerald Duchene from New York** and the amazing singer **Rachel Goodman from Augusta (Georgia)**.

For the Italian section I’ll be working with fellow producer and multi-instrumentalist **Emilio Albertoni** from my hometown Ravenna, with whom I released a single last year titled [_Non sai chi sono_ ↗︎](https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/track/non-sai-chi-sono-remix).

In other news, I joined Mastodon a week ago, enjoying its noticeable difference from Twitter and mainstream social media. So far so good. Read the [**Mastodon update** ↗︎](/blog/joining-mastodon/).

Hopefully this would be one of my last newsletters using Mailchimp. I’m looking forward to transitioning to a simpler provider. I’m not really interested in email marketing or tracking people, I’d rather keep tabs with people I care about.
