We used our custom SASS and Javascript-driven framework called <em>ResponsiFarm</em> to build PHP modules and add <strong>progressive enhancement</strong> functionality on top of our designer's vision. The landing pages converted leads connecting to UniCredit's acquisition forms.

Here is a brilliant <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/portfolio/acquisition-landing-pages-and-forms/">case study on the UX and design side</a> of the same project.

<h2 class="text-center text-uppercase">Client review</h2>
> UI Farm’s innovative workflow and unique skills has given us a very clear insight into our customers’ behaviour and preferences, which has considerably boosted our account application conversions. Thanks to UI Farm’s approach, we have been able to significantly improve the experience delivered to our customers and prospects, and make changes that may have seemed minor to us but have resulted in significant conversion lifts. UI Farm has truly changed our approach to Interaction Design.
