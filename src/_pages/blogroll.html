summary: 'A partial list of websites (in alphabetical order) that I consistently follow through RSS. As Matthew Graybosch once said, "<em>Pages like this one are how website operators used to promote other websites they like before Google and the SEO industry ruined the World Wide Web</em>". I tend to only add people with whom I have a dialog, either in person, via email or messages.'
