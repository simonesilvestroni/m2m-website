<section>
<p>I’m Simone, a gen X with a straight to the point attitude. Based in the UK, I play bass and <a href='/sound-design/'>design sound</a> under the moniker <em>Minutes to Midnight</em>. It's a reference to the <em>Doomsday Clock</em>, a connection with the world I grew up in during the Cold War.</p>
<p>In previous lives I worked as a game audio designer and a web developer. Today my day job is with the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>To dig deeper, I wrote a <a href="/personal-manifesto/">personal manifesto</a>.</p>
