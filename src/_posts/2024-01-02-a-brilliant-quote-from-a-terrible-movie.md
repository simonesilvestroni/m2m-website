summary: "The Christmas movie <em>Serendipity</em>, that I'm very sorry to have inflicted on both my wife and myself, was released in 2001, preceding the current state of the web by a couple of decades. It had a single highlight, when the character played by Jeremy Piven erupted in a fantastic rant."
