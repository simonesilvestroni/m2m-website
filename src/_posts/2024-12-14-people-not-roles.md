summary: "Back in 2005, I wrote a series of angry entries on my journal, where I lashed out at the infamous attempts by far left fringe groups to kickstart a revolution in Italy. They terrorised the country for almost two decades during the Cold War, getting almost zero popular support, and spreading nothing but fear, and grief."

My greatest peeve about that story was related to how these people had injured, maimed, and killed based on the role of their targets. To be able to perform those actions, they had conditioned themselves to only see the role, not the person. That's a police officer, not a father of two young children; that is a judge, not a caring man; that is the president of the Party in power, not an attentive grandfather who actually listened to what the left had to say in his country.

It's not surprising that, twenty years later, I still can't stand when anybody introduces themselves stating their job role, instead of saying *who they are*. Mister Robot is always right â€” we live in a kingdom of bullshit.
