summary: "It was slow at first, almost imperceptible; then, one session at a time, it grew to a full-fledged short (but deep) concept album. I finally started producing music again."

I'm applying the final touches before the client's feedback, then there is mastering. Can't wait to share this new material. After two years, even though I didn't write any of it, it feels thrilling to be back on producing and mixing.

My last time was in Italy, it wasn't enjoyable at all, and I think it somehow traumatised me by sucking all the fun out of it. Back in Cambridge, during my second-favourite season — Winter — I'm overwriting that bad memory by working on a concept album in French. It's made of 14 short songs, no fuss no muss, straight to a meaningful deep message.

I couldn't have hoped for a better new start.
