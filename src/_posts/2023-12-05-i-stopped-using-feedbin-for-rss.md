summary: 'When my Feedbin annual renewal approached I decided to look at it objectively, and check if a cheaper alternative existed. Turns out I had it already.'

The $50 fee for the service wasn't dramatic â€” however, since I've been on a path to cut any non-necessary expenses and reduce the amount of external tools I use, I looked for a change. My RSS reader of choice is NetNewsWire 6 on macOS, which I love. Ever since I bought a 3-year old second-hand iPhone SE, I started using the same software on iOS because of the familiarity with the interface and the gestures. That's when I realised that I could simply export an [OPML file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) of my RSS subscriptions, import it within NNW on the Mac, activate iCloud on both devices and have my feeds in sync, including a read/not read status.

I liked Feedbin, it's a good service. Nonetheless, after switching to Pocket for read-later articles and videos, its perks didn't appeal to me anymore.
