> There really is no shortcut to forgetting someone. You just have to endure missing them everyday until you don't anymore. We cannot know where the heart will lead us. Simone really brought this over the line producing the vocal track and Dan rose to the occasion with his singing. As a musical team, I feel we get stronger with each song. It is a personal quest we are on, to see how long we can go without running out of steam or ideas. Never I hope.
