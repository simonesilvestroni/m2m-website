summary: 'Part of my ‘degrowth’ series: why I’ve been using less and less Apple products. Might sound like venting, though it’s not.'

As a quick premise, I don't judge anyone's choices when it comes to computer hardware and software. Therefore, I'm okay with people relying on Apple software (and hardware) _for everything they do_. I've been there too. As I've embarked on a quest to decrease my digital footprint and achieve some form of actual [degrowth]({{ site.url }}/blog/tag/degrowth/), this is something I can't leave out. Apart from strongly disliking the recent incarnations of macOS, I believe that the $2tn company is hell-bent on a path that's impossible for me to agree with. To each their own.

I started using Apple products in 1993, and despite knowing them from the inside out, I've been slowly walking away over the last few years. _Why_? Sure, there's the [rejection of walled gardens]({{ site.url }}/blog/tag/walled-gardens/) (or ecosystems, as they like to call it), in favour of cross-platform solutions that let me switch to different devices and/or operating systems, if needed. However, I can't bypass my increasing moral conflict towards Apple's environment-killing policies, disguised behind [greenwashing](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-isnt-as-green-as-it-pretends-to-be/) and virtue signalling. Whenever I get the counter-argument "_what's the alternative? Google? They're even worse_", my rational response is that by the same logic I don't use neither Google nor Microsoft. Though, the first instinctive answer would go like this: _remember when none of us was tied to a corporate ecosystem, and we survived and thrived regardless_?

I've already touched on the topic of [cloud syncing]({{ site.url }}/blog/i-guess-i-dont-trust-the-cloud/). At the moment, besides the Finder, which is macOS' filesystem manager, the Apple programs that I still use daily are Calendar, Preview, and Text Edit — all replaceable. There's plenty of excellent stuff out there, whether open source or paid. Speaking honestly, I consider my macOS full of bloatware, like any Samsung or Xiaomi mobile phone out there. Even though I don't have iCloud enabled, my system has 7 running processes related to it, using CPU power to do something I have no interest in, and _zero control_ over.

## One more thing&hellip;

After monitoring external calls to the internet through Little Snitch, I finally blocked the operating system from forcibly downloading an OS update that I specifically _don't want_. I'm talking about an installer weighing `13GB` that was constantly being pushed to my `/Applications` folder, no matter how many times I deleted it. No way to disable this toxic behaviour, I tried everything. If that's not wasting broadband, electricity, environmental resources, I don't know what is. And it tells me all I need to know about the _principles_ of the corporation.
