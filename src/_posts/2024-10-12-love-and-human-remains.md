I absolutely love the story, the characters, the dialogues, the music. Surprising how I never knew it was set in Edmonton, Canada — I guess when watching films that have been dubbed in another language, multiple layers of meaning are irremediably lost.

A few things that I thought I had forgotten about the Nineties: the scare of AIDS, and above everything something that made me sad. The simple realisation that we used to commit to communicate somewhat in person, either physically or on the telephone. It felt different: we got out more often, met more often, exchange thoughts, hopes, fears, while talking to each other. No distractions.

Also: said communication was pretty much asynchronous. The film is dominated by answering machines, always available while people were out, but checked out on *their own terms*. Not that the 1990s were a golden era per se — I'm not ruminating on nostalgia — it's the thought of a time where everyone were more authentic, more present. More real.
