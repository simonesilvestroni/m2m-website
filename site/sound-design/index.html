	<h2>Relevant Work</h2>
	<details>
		<summary>Curriculum</summary>
		<p>A graduated musician, I freelanced as a bass player during the 1990s, acquiring audio skills as a studio assistant. Years later I landed a game sound designer role for a Playstation2 platformer. As team leader, I participated to the 2002 Game Developer Conference in San Jose, where I joined the Game Audio Guild Network on the day of its foundation, witnessing to the launch of Steam by Valve.</p>
		<p>I switched to the digital domain after building my studio, specialising in mix and master. I wrote and released songs as concept albums based on a personal storylines. While working as a music producer, mixer and bassist for independent artists, I published an ebook about project management in the music industry.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>Tools I use</summary>
		<ul>
			<li>Studied bass, composition, arrangement, graduating in my early 20s.</li>
			<li>I learned the foundation of audio signal flow, microphone theory, and the recording process, in the analog world. While working with the first DAWs during the 1990s, such as Cubase and Notator Logic, I got hooked, and fully embraced the digital domain.</li>
			<li>Pioneered modern game audio in the early 2000s, expanding and applying my knowledge with scoring to picture, dialogue and vocals editing, sound effects, field recording, Foley.</li>
			<li>During the game design years I used SoundForge, WaveLab, in-house game engines, Alienbrain, and later learned FMOD, Wwise, Unity.</li>
			<li>Switched later to mixing, production, audio restoration, mastering, for which I graduated at Berklee.</li>
			<li>Certified by Apple for Logic Pro, I later moved to Pro Tools, and finally REAPER. I’m also a passionate Reason user.</li>
			<li>Despite an extensive collection, I prefer to learn at my best the sound and peculiarity of a subset of audio plug-ins. I specialise in: Waves, Soundtoys, iZotope Ozone and RX, Tokyo Dawn, Voxengo.</li>
