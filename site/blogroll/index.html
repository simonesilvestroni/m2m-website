	<h2 class="visually-hidden">The list</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://alirezahayati.com/">Ali Reza Hayati</a></dt>
		<dd>An entrepreneur, hacker, cypherpunk, and user freedom activist working to spread the use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing free technologies to help people take full control over what they own. I share a lot with Ali, and love his gentle irony.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://alisonwilder.net/">Alison Wilder</a></dt>
		<dd>Music obsessive with a wild passion for beautiful and efficient systems. Advocates for human-scale thinking & design. I'm in love with how she's able to bend the tone of her voice to the needs of the music she writes.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://chriswiegman.com/">Chris Wiegman</a></dt>
		<dd>Engineering manager, teacher and speaker, whose work focuses on WordPress, developer experience and emphasizes humane and sustainable technology. I enjoy how our online debates carry a satisfying feeling of reciprocal improvement.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://flamedfury.com/">Flamed Fury</a></dt>
		<dd>I got to know Flamed thanks to the networking power of the Fediverse, where strangers read other strangers' posts and connect dots that were naturally there. Flamed insists on themes that I care about a lot, often using the same arguments.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://garrit.xyz/">Garrit Franke</a></dt>
		<dd>I’ve found about Garrit a while ago, back when I was researching the indieweb, and never stopped following his RSS feed. We share several habits, including our common love for taking notes on small pocket-sized notepads. I like his weird lists a lot, such as life goals and impossible tasks.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://write.as/imgn/">Imogen</a></dt>
		<dd>She’s a scientist, songwriter and storyteller interested in data privacy, decentralized communication and free open source software. I followed Imogen on Mastodon because of her majestic taste in music and ended up finding a human connection with a kindred spirit.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://blog.jpnearl.com/">J.P. Wing</a></dt>
		<dd>J.P.’s blog is one of the first I read on a daily basis. He’s so open and genuine that I feel like I’m part of his life, even though we never met and don’t exchange thoughts much, other than on Mastodon. I love getting lost in his posts, watching the beautiful pictures, following the adventures of his cat Truman, and being a quiet distant observer in the life he shares with his husband.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://jan.boddez.net/">Jan Boddez</a></dt>
		<dd>Jan is a mechanical engineer, amateur guitarist, and web standards, WordPress and Laravel enthusiast from Belgium. By following him on Mastodon, I can appreciate his thorough, empathetic and gentle approach to all things, not just tech-related.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://www.thisdaysportion.com/">Leon Paternoster</a></dt>
		<dd><em>This day’s portion</em> is Leon’s personal blog, and also his experimental playfield in terms of web design. I can load the site once a day and have a good chance of seeing some meaningful change. Beside liking his takes on what he writes about, I’m in love with his fine taste for minimalism and a good balanced typography.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://www.lkhrs.com">Luke Harris</a></dt>
		<dd>Web designer specializing in WordPress, Webflow, and static site generators. He lives and works remotely in Corpus Christi, Texas. Except for geolocation, I have a ton in common with Luke.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">Manuel Moreale</a></dt>
		<dd>A past version of myself is almost perfectly described by his about page, which means we share a great deal of viewpoints on different aspects of life. He speaks his mind in a direct way, doesn’t care for sugarcoating his opinions, and goes straight to the point.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://starbreaker.org/">Matthew Graybosch</a></dt>
		<dd>Author of the novels <em>Without Bloodshed</em> and <em>Silent Clarion</em>, he has a day job as a software developer. Not afraid to tell things by their name, he runs his personal website with the same directness. I devour his posts, like a book that’s impossible to put down.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://www.michalzelazny.com/">Michał Żelazny</a></dt>
		<dd>His blog, named <em>Untitled</em>, is loaded with feelings that I can relate to. Michał and I never met in person, however we share a common point of view on so many things, it's become a common thing to have an email exchange after each publication.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://crashthearcade.com/">Mike Haynes</a></dt>
		<dd>A fellow introverted, I love Mike's website, the simple and minimalistic yet detailed good design, the cool idea of an 'ephemeral' photo gallery that's not related to what people consider online images nowadays.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://pimoore.ca/">Peter Moore</a></dt>
		<dd>Pete defines himself as a <em>bearded smartass, future embarrassment, permanent geek</em>. He's a Gen X as I am, and I feel this communal origin: we share many a thing, including a love for typewriters. What he writes often hits home, so every few blog posts of his, we have an email exchange.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://alongtheray.com">Raymond Hines</a></dt>
		<dd>A lifelong entrepreneur who lives a nomadic life in a tiny camper since 2016. In his inspiring blog he shares the literal and figurative journey in all manner of ways: the highs, lows, introspectives, poetry, photographs, and more.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com">Silvia Maggi</a></dt>
		<dd>Web designer focused on usability, accessibility and information architecture. An expert in designing using web standards since 2004, she curates the inspiration series <em>Design, Digested</em>. Photography is her life-long passion.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://readsteven.com">Steven Hoefer</a></dt>
		<dd>He makes things with his imagination and his hands. When writing doesn’t engage his hands enough he invents whimsical gadgets. Author of <em>The Embassy</em> Series, an ongoing series of sci-fi novels.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://tommi.space/zibenglish">Tommaso Marmo</a></dt>
		<dd>An enthusiastic philosophy, international studies and economics student. He does many things. His website perfectly conveys the feeling of the weird and open exciting web of the 1990s.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://brainbaking.com/">Wouter Groeneveld</a></dt>
		<dd>He's many things, a teacher, researcher, programmer and bread baker. I love Wouter's way of thinking about the web and programming in general, plus he's the source of inspiration for a few functionality added to my websites.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://blogroll.org/">Ye Olde Blogroll</a></dt>
		<dd>A humanly curated list of fine personal & independent blogs that are updated regularly. <em>No algorithms ever</em>. Managed by Raymond Hines.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="https://www.zinzy.website">Zinzy Waleson Geene</a></dt>
		<dd>She works at the intersection of research, design, language, and strategy. I love the content on her website and the fact she's not afraid to experiment with brutalist design, which I'm very fond of.</dd>
