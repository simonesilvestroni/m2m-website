	<h2>What I stand for</h2>
	<p>Leading a quiet life in a time where noise, toxic controversy and anger have become dominant, is a struggle. Capitalism seems to favour abject things like patriarchy, racism, sexism, homophobia, and an incessant rush to accumulate wealth at the expense of people and the environment.</p>
	<p>I don't contribute to this hive mind mentality, especially when fuelled by soulless corporations. I've expanded on these topics in <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/personal-manifesto/"><code>/personal-manifesto</code></a>.</p>

	<h2>What I do</h2>
	<p>While my small-town boy introversion is challenging in a raucous world, it has brilliant side effects. Helped by an eidetic memory, and the ability to hyper focus, I can dig deep into several interests, learning and honing new crafts over time. The result is a capacity to work comfortably in both creative and technical roles.</p>
	<p>Graduated from music school, I acquired production chops during the 1990s. After moving to the big city, I worked as a print designer and editor to fund my music activities. Excited by web design as a natural evolution of the publishing industry, I built my first site in 1997.</p>
	<p>Shortly after, I received an invite for a job interview with a company that was looking for a web developer who could also understand design. As they were starting production on a platform video game, I <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/joining-playstos/">landed the double role of sound and web designer</a>, bringing my duality to a full circle.</p>
	<p>I wrote and released a concept album about a real-life personal story, called <a href='https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/after-1989/'><em>After 1989</em></a>.<br><br></p>

	<h2>Today</h2>
	<p>I care about accessibility, <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/tag/sustainability/">sustainability</a>, the environment. I consider this site a part of the renaissance of what is now called the <em>small web</em>, which is the philosophy that was behind the web when I started.</p>
