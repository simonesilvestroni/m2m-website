	<p>Not long ago, I wrote a personal account (in two parts) of what it meant to <a href="/blog/releasing-an-album-as-an-independent-artist-pt1/">release a concept album as an indie artist</a> in 2019. Specifically talking about the consequences of the music industry move to streaming, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something that truly bothered me was the fact that Spotify completed the commodification of music in a way that I couldn’t stand. Everyone kept repeating how good of a marketing tool for musicians it was. I could never see that. Spotify don’t tell you who your fans are, don’t allow fans to get in touch with you and surely isn’t interested in making indie music profitable.
<br />[…]<br />
It wasn’t the ridiculous trickle of pennies that the streaming services sent me over the following thirty-eight months, nor the fact that Bandcamp was indeed in a different league (I knew my followers, got messages, reviews, sold CDs and digital albums). It was the obnoxious feeling that corporate social media, and Spotify, weren’t a place where I wanted to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This morning I received an email from <abbr title="Performing Right Society">PRS</abbr> For Music (UK), with the promising jolly subject: <em>You're being paid royalties today</em>, followed by an announcement regarding how many millions or British Pounds are being paid out today globally (<code>161</code>), and a request to check my statement for more information.</p>

<p>After logging in, I see an unexpected amount of online performances. Since I haven't been playing live or anything, I'm surprised and a little confused. Downloaded the statement, I dig into the numbers, and discover that <a href="https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/track/sachsenhausen">a single song</a> from my <em>After 1989</em> album in 2019 racked up <strong>1,568,434 streams</strong>. A <em>million and a half</em>. Baffling. How could it be? I know I keep neglecting all the streaming stats because I don’t give a damn about it, but I’m sure I should have caught a whiff about it. I suppose it might have been included in some documentary that I don't know anything about.</p>

<h2 id="down-to-the-nitty-gritty">Down to the nitty-gritty</h2>

<p>The biggest share of those million and a half streams comes from <em>Alliance YouTube Limited Download / On Demand Streaming Service Video</em>, divided by the following countries, ordered by number of streams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Germany (<code>999,738</code>)</li>
  <li>France (<code>181,979</code>)</li>
  <li>Netherlands (<code>127,635</code>)</li>
  <li>United Kingdom (<code>93,962</code>)</li>
  <li>Belgium (<code>81,729</code>)</li>
  <li>Sweden (<code>35,171</code>)</li>
  <li>Italy (<code>32,469</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides YouTube, a further chunk — tallying <code>15,750</code> — is from <em>Alliance TikTok Settlement 2014-2020 United Kingdom Limited Download / On Demand Streaming Service</em>. I don't even remember to have pushed my music onto TikTok (or whatever it was called before), so I checked with CDBaby, and yes, I did.</p>

<p>Checking out the dates in the report, I realise the time period is more than 3 years, from 1 July 2019 to 30 September 2022. The timeframe is a bit weird, since my album was released in November 2019, but I assume it's all due to the fact that I'd been performing <a href="/blog/live-shows/">live with Callum Gardner</a> around the UK before that (I got some pennies from it as well).</p>

<h2 id="new-car-caviar">New car, caviar!</h2>

<p>So how much did I get for more than a million and a half streams on YouTube? <mark>46 GBP</mark>. That's around $50, for comparison. I still don't know where all those listens come from, because this is the streaming industry: a commodified bullshit that only care about corporate shareholders.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you're and independent artist wishing to publish your music online, feel free to go ahead with Spotify, YouTube Music <em>et al</em>. Maybe you'll be lucky too, and be able to afford a pizza and a beer for two, 3 years later.</p>
