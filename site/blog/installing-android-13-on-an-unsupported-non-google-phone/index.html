	<p>I paid my Redmi Note 7 mobile phone around <code>£130</code>. First and foremost, I strongly hate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">planned obsolescence</a>, along with its consequent reckless environmental abuse. Other than money and greed, there’s not a single rational reason behind releasing new phones every year, especially models that can’t be repaired.</p>

<p>Xiaomi told me that <em>no new Android updates</em> would be made available for the device. I’ve had enough of depending on a manufacturer’s whims for the safety and durability of the hardware I buy.</p>

<h2 id="recent-annoyances">Recent annoyances</h2>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>I’d been having issues with MIUI recently, mostly random reboots and boot loops. Reinstalling the OS, a time-consuming procedure, didn’t fix them.</li>
  <li>MIUI activates by default a ton of “suggested” features, which is a preposterous euphemism for invasive ads popping up in core apps at all times. The operation of deactivating them is per se tiresome, as they’re all scattered around numerous settings.</li>
  <li>The default OS is bloated with apps that cannot be removed. Also, despite having set Firefox as my default browser, they keep insisting on opening their own MI browser — which has been found to be <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/xiaomi-browser-history.html">akin to spyware</a> — from links in core apps.</li>
  <li>Every single alternative launcher failed to work in the long term, with issues that regularly crept up and increased in time. Maybe it was because of Xiaomi’s hyper-aggressive battery policies, I don’t know and don’t even care anymore.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="first-unlock-the-device">First: unlock the device</h2>

<p>Most Xiaomi devices come factory locked, which means it’s impossible to rewrite the bootloader without unlocking. Obligatory note: the procedure voids any type of warranty or support from the manufacturer.</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>Enabling developer options: in Settings → My Device I tapped repeatedly on the MIUI version, until a pop-up message <em>You are now a developer!</em> appeared on screen.</li>
  <li>USB debugging: activated <em>USB debugging</em> and <em>Install via USB</em> in Settings → Additional Settings → Developer Options`.</li>
  <li>Unlocking: <a href="https://www.miui.com/unlock/index_en.html">Xiaomi’s Unlock app</a> required a Windows machine.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="second-custom-recovery-bootloader">Second: custom recovery bootloader</h2>

<p>I chose <a href="https://wiki.orangefox.tech/en/home">OrangeFox</a>, one of the most popular bootloaders. Downloading the correct version <a href="https://orangefox.download/en/device/lavender">for my specific device</a> was a bit trickier. My phone is a <strong>Redmi Note 7 Pro</strong>, whose codename is <em>violet</em>, but when I flashed the recovery for that model, I involuntarily bricked the phone — or so  it seeemed.</p>

<p>After several hours, close to giving up, I’d decided to read the bootloader log from the terminal of my Window machine, through <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/adb"><code>adb</code></a>. To my utter surprise, the device was listed as <em>lavender</em> (code name for the regular Redmi Note 7) and not <em>violet</em>. Did they sell me a pro device that wasn’t really pro? Whatever. Once re-downloaded the OrangeFox image for <em>lavender</em>, it worked like a charm.</p>

<h2 id="third-boot-into-recovery">Third: boot into recovery</h2>

<p>Next, I rebooted the device by pushing the power button together with the volume up button. After OrangeFox finally greeted me, I proceeded to wipe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dalvik</li>
  <li>Cache</li>
  <li>System</li>
  <li>Data</li>
  <li>Internal storage</li>
</ul>

<p>Afterwards, I hit <kbd>Back</kbd> and tapped on <kbd>Format Data</kbd>. Typed <code>yes</code>, hit the back button again, tapped the bottom icon <kbd>Menu</kbd> and chose Reboot → Recovery. If it wasn’t already, that’s when I was supposed to connect the device to the Windows machine via USB cable.</p>

<h2 id="fourth-custom-rom">Fourth: custom ROM</h2>

<p>My choice was <a href="https://www.pling.com/p/1741470/">Android 13 for Pixel phones</a>, which weighted around 2GB. From the computer, I copied the .zip file onto the internal storage. When the OrangeFox recovery had booted up again, I tapped on the <abbr title="Read Only Memory">ROM</abbr> .zip file from the main menu tab <kbd>Files</kbd> and authorized the installation.</p>

<p>Another reboot later, the animated Google logo told me that everything was going fine. Android 13 was installing. The classic Android setup routine followed.</p>

<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<p>Pretty much everything I was expecting worked, and some more.</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>My old but still capable smartphone can stay up to date.</li>
  <li>No random reboots.</li>
  <li>No ads.</li>
  <li>No bloated apps. I even removed most of Google’s native apps without encountering a single issue.</li>
  <li>Custom launchers work perfectly.</li>
  <li>Battery life has improved in a way I’m struggling to explain: a single charge lasts <em>3.5 days</em> with average use; <em>2.5 days</em> with intensive use.</li>
  <li>Animations are sleeker and the interactions feel fluid and faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a biggie: <em>I never logged in to a Google account</em> and everything works smoothly. I’m using <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> and <a href="https://auroraoss.com/">Aurora Store</a> to download apps. I feel less spied on now that I have a sort of Google Pixel native Android operating system. I’ll probably want to check one of the Google-free alternatives such as <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>, but so far I feel good where I am. Everything works, including all my OTP codes in <a href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis</a>, which were re-imported in seconds from an encrypted backup.</p>

<p>I don’t sync the phone with any cloud, I use the open source and private <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> to help myself with contacts and copying or deleting pictures from the phone to macOS and viceversa. My Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 (non Pro, apparently) is now seen as “Pixel 6 Pro”.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>In two weeks, I’ve only experienced two minor problems, both connected to the same feature:</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>I seem to be incapable of shooting QR codes directly. I have to photograph them with the camera, and then load the photo in a QR reader.</li>
  <li>The camera sometimes freezes on loading. To unblock, I just have to tap on a different scenario: portrait, night mode or whichever is there, and go back to the one I need.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike several bug reports on LineageOS’ forums about the Redmi Note 7 camera which is only working at low resolutions, with this Android 13 ROM I can shoot pictures at the maximum resolution offered by the hardware.</p>

<h3 id="revert-to-miui">Revert to MIUI?</h3>

<p>If, for whatever reason, I wish to go back to MIUI, all I have to do is download <a href="https://xiaomiflashtool.com/">Xiaomi’s flash tool</a> and follow the instructions. I did exactly that when I bricked the phone, before re-flashing the recovery for the correct device, and it worked.</p>

<aside class="warning">
  <p><strong>Edit, a month later</strong> — The whole "Pro/non-Pro" issue was my fault. Apparently I had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_Effect">Mandela effect</a> — in fact, I’ve found the original box, which clearly states <em>Redmi Note 7</em>, not <em>Note 7 Pro</em>. The issue related to QR codes only exists in WhatsApp for whatever reason, which is definitely not a problem.</p>
