	<h2 id="drums-restoration">Drums restoration</h2>

<p>In 2017 I was <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/callum-gardner-debut-single/">producing the debut single</a> for London-based singer-songwriter Callum Gardner. Most of the tracking was handled by an external studio in London. When I received the audio tracks, I noticed a few issues with the drums.</p>

<h3 id="first-issue-squeaky-pedal">First issue: squeaky pedal</h3>

<p>A repeating squeaky sound coming from the hi-hat pedal was captured by all the microphones. This was a major problem.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/audio-editing-rx-squeaky-hihat.jpg" alt="iZotope RX spectral view showing the squeaky hi-hat noise" width="1024" height="604">
<em>iZotope RX spectral view showing the squeaky hi-hat noise</em></p>

<h4 id="squeaky-pedal-before--after">Squeaky pedal, before &amp; after</h4>

<p>Spread over the entire song, the noise is clearly audible â€” especially problematic in the quiet sections.</p>

<div class="audioplayer">

  </audio>
</div>

<p>After cutting some of the noise with a gentle gate on both snare and rack, I spent an hour or so in iZotope RX cleaning up the hi-hat and overhead tracks. The squeaky hi-hat pedal is gone.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="second-issue-no-room-sound">Second issue: no room sound</h3>

<p>The drums overhead tracks were recorded with a single mic, therefore mono, with no room recording. I immediately thought it could be improved.</p>

<h4 id="mono-drums-overhead-before--after">Mono drums overhead, before &amp; after</h4>

<div class="audioplayer">

<p>My choice was a gentle drum doubling technique. After a MIDI capture of kick, snare, hi-hat and crash, I fired up my drums virtual instrument of choice, Addictive Drums 2 by XLN. With a clever use of pan and room verb in the plug-in, I managed to recreate the missing stereo image with a nice studio vibe.</p>

<p>The final result is the original drums with the MIDI doubling blended in to increase the effect and make the percussion more incisive.</p>

<h3 id="issue-isolating-drums-from-a-mastered-track">Issue: isolating drums from a mastered track</h3>

<p>For the last twenty years, I've been obsessed with the idea of recovering my late cousin's drum playing so that I could have him on my tracks. I did it with my song <a href="https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/track/the-logic"><em>The Logic</em></a>, however that was more of a drum replacement process. In fact, I mostly used short sections and drum fills that were already in isolation in their original form.</p>

<p>When iZotope released <em>Master Rebalance</em> as part of Ozone and RX, I tried the full process of taking the drums out of an existing song.</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>In Reaper, I imported a full track from a CD he released with his band in the late 1990s.</li>
  <li>Several passages of Ozone's module later, I removed vocals and bass.</li>
  <li>I cleaned up piano and distorted guitars with RX.</li>
  <li>After importing the bounced audio back in Reaper, I detected the tempo and used <em>dynamic split</em> to catch the transients I needed (kick and snare), assigning a virtual instrument to the resulting MIDI track. In this case I chose Steven Slate's Drums.</li>
  <li>Playing with velocity and adding a little hi-hat, I blended the sampled percussion with the original.</li>
  <li>Created a room bus with a little bit of Valhalla Supermassive verb, fed by MIDI kick and snare to add an ambient vibe.</li>
  <li>I also re-processed the original isolated drums: a gate to remove vague remnants of vocals, an EQ and Waves' MV2 to enhance quieter sounds and glue the whole part.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="isolated-drums-before--after">Isolated drums, before &amp; After</h4>

<p>The first ten seconds of the original song, followed by the same section with the isolated drums plus drum doubling in Reaper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the band I started, Simone was the most involved with regards to arrangement and dynamics. Using his fretless bass, he completely switched the mood of any given part. Simone and I have been working on my new releases, and itâ€™s been an incredibly worthwhile experience. Itâ€™s great to have him with me to lead the production side and also to influence the arrangement. Iâ€™m really happy to have a producer that understands completely my process as a songwriter.
