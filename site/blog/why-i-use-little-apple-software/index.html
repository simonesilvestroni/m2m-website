	<p>As a quick premise, I don't judge anyone's choices when it comes to computer hardware and software. Therefore, I'm okay with people relying on Apple software (and hardware) <em>for everything they do</em>. I've been there too. As I've embarked on a quest to decrease my digital footprint and achieve some form of actual <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/tag/degrowth/">degrowth</a>, this is something I can't leave out. Apart from strongly disliking the recent incarnations of macOS, I believe that the $2tn company is hell-bent on a path that's impossible for me to agree with. To each their own.</p>

<p>I started using Apple products in 1993, and despite knowing them from the inside out, I've been slowly walking away over the last few years. <em>Why</em>? Sure, there's the <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/tag/walled-gardens/">rejection of walled gardens</a> (or ecosystems, as they like to call it), in favour of cross-platform solutions that let me switch to different devices and/or operating systems, if needed. However, I can't bypass my increasing moral conflict towards Apple's environment-killing policies, disguised behind <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-isnt-as-green-as-it-pretends-to-be/">greenwashing</a> and virtue signalling. Whenever I get the counter-argument "<em>what's the alternative? Google? They're even worse</em>", my rational response is that by the same logic I don't use neither Google nor Microsoft. Though, the first instinctive answer would go like this: <em>remember when none of us was tied to a corporate ecosystem, and we survived and thrived regardless</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple could lead the way in sustainable products and influence other companies to follow suit, but instead, it chooses to greenwash unsustainable practices.
<cite><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-should-stop-using-the-environment-as-a-sales-tactic-and-start-caring-for-the-planet/">Adrian Kingsley-Hughes</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've already touched on the topic of <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/i-guess-i-dont-trust-the-cloud/">cloud syncing</a>. At the moment, besides the Finder, which is macOS' filesystem manager, the Apple programs that I still use daily are Calendar, Preview, and Text Edit — all replaceable. There's plenty of excellent stuff out there, whether open source or paid. Speaking honestly, I consider my macOS full of bloatware, like any Samsung or Xiaomi mobile phone out there. Even though I don't have iCloud enabled, my system has 7 running processes related to it, using CPU power to do something I have no interest in, and <em>zero control</em> over.</p>

<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing…</h2>

<p>After monitoring external calls to the internet through Little Snitch, I finally blocked the operating system from forcibly downloading an OS update that I specifically <em>don't want</em>. I'm talking about an installer weighing <code>13GB</code> that was constantly being pushed to my <code>/Applications</code> folder, no matter how many times I deleted it. No way to disable this toxic behaviour, I tried everything. If that's not wasting broadband, electricity, environmental resources, I don't know what is. And it tells me all I need to know about the <em>principles</em> of the corporation.</p>
