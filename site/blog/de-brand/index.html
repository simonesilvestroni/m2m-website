	<p>Today, a post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231223023152/https://alirezahayati.com/">by my online friend Ali</a> generated a lively exchange where all the participants agreed on one point: how we were all fooled by the idea of turning our online presence into a <em>brand</em>. I was surprised by the instinctive nature of this collective refusal, like a second nature kicking in as soon as the topic arises. Ali wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My personal blog is my personal blog. I write whatever I want and won't care if you think blogs should only be for one subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After liking his post, I replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the greatest mistakes we've ever done was to fall into that trap that we should be promoting ourselves as "brands". You know, with all the 'create a persona' that would reflect your best work on social media and the rest of the crap. Fuck that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="brandifying-my-online-life-was-a-mistake">Brandifying my online life was a mistake</h2>

<p>Can’t precisely recall when the faze started, though I vividly remember how during the production of my debut album I fell for this absolute bullshit of an idea. Can’t even assign blame to someone in particular because nobody convinced me, <em>I did it to myself</em>. What makes my choice more baffling is that, even when the word <em>influencer</em> didn’t exist, I've always disliked the same type of public figure. Back then, it was people who were <strong>projecting a successful persona</strong>, obsessively focused on one thing. That thing, repeated to death, would become the key aspect making them recognisable and ultimately build their <em>brand</em>. A single-topic identity revolving around a job, their output on social media reflected the same push, consistency and reiteration.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in late 2016 I took an online marketing course, started following certain people in the audio field, watched their online material and read their articles and books. I was establishing a new online presence centred around my music production skills and writing a debut album, so I fell for the same honey trap. Unfortunately, that also implied wasting a lot of time on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. I’d been into the one-person brand mantra for four long years. In the same Mastodon discussion, <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com">Silvia</a> added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's something I now see as an Instagram thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which makes perfect sense to me, because Instagram is arguably the peak of this deranged approach. To cut the story short, I quit mainstream social media in August 2020, <a href="/blog/life-after-social-networks/">regaining sanity along the way</a>. On its own, leaving the dumb circus of people who keep convincing themselves they’re <em>riding the algorithm</em> was cathartic. The choice was a revelation: I felt free from a shitload of ridiculous shenanigans that had no point other than having me playing someone else’s game.</p>

<h2 id="de-brandify">De-brandify</h2>

<p>Words are crucial, therefore changing the lexicon was the first step. I stopped considering the web as a place where to find an <em>audience</em>. I quit using the word <em>users</em>, switching to <em>people</em> instead and rewrote my pages to reflect my true self. Eradicating the marketing jargon was also paramount. I don’t produce <em>content</em>, I write and record sounds and sometimes lyrics. Songs, music, sound effects should evoke an emotional reaction and <em>content</em> doesn’t reflect any of that. The commodification of art has been overdone already, corporate conglomerates don’t need small actors to be part of it.</p>

<p>I refactored my website. In line with my long-time interest in <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/degrowth/">degrowth</a>, I ditched Wordpress opting for a static site instead. The choice alone caused a shrink in size by almost 90%. Then, I removed the obligatory redundant huge headers featuring wasteful big images (<em>impactful</em>!). Stopped looking for the perfect <em>elevator pitch</em> because I gave up the idea that I should be selling something at all costs. I joined the <a href="https://indieweb.org">Indieweb</a>. Since I don’t like being spied on, why whould I do the same to others? I deleted my Google Analytics account and wiped its code. I don’t pry on people who read my site, what’s even the point? To <em>ride the SEO</em>?</p>

<p>No comments on the site. I don’t need to show <em>engagement</em> to prove some point, I prefer private asynchronous communication. If people have their websites, they can use webmentions to reply and exchange opinions. Or even better: they can write plain old e-mails through the easy link at the footer of each post. I wrote a short manifesto collecting <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/personal-manifesto/">some of my principles</a>. A few years ago <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/project-management/">I wrote a free ebook</a> and made it available on this website. As a stealth remnant of my <em>brandified</em> days, the download was still tied to a small form where people would give me their e-mail address and silently being added to the newsletter. All they wanted was to read a free ebook but I still subscribed to that model of <em>fishing users</em>. I removed the form and left a simple link, no strings attached.</p>

<p>The work isn’t done yet. I’m sure I still have bits here and there that I hadn’t noticed. Get in touch if you find one.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I accept the fact that I'm never going to understand why I fell for this awful concept. But, as with every failure along the way, I prefer to focus on something positive. Building a more authentic self online and offline is an example and the very Mastodon debate that prompted this post is proof that it works. Leaving the idea of a permanent fake perfect mask brought me closer to a genuinely caring — and openly prone to mistakes — real me.</p>
