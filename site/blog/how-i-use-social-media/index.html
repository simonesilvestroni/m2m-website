	<p>It's been three years since I rejected the morally corrupt, privacy-invading, time (and energy) waster that is corporate social media, and it works. Besides email, chats on either <abbr title="Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol">XMPP</abbr> or Telegram, and a couple of audio-related forums, I only interact online on <a href="https://sonomu.club/@m2m">Mastodon</a>. A decentralised social media, part of a larger interconnected network called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse</a>, it's independent and open source. Designed to be small, it can't be owned by a single entity. Its ethos is one of inclusion, also reflected by tools that favours accessibility, and a fine tuning of the strictly chronological timeline through detailed filters. The fediverse currently <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/enjoy-the-difference/">suits me well</a>. My approach to Mastodon has consolidated to these practices:</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>Checking out anyone who follows me, using a few criteria on what constitutes a potentially interesting person. It's often empirical.</li>
  <li>Following (or following back) people who actively interact with others, generally post interesting things, seem empathetic, and are <em>not a brand</em>. If there's no authenticity, I see no point. Broadcasting a successful <em>online persona</em> is not being social.</li>
  <li>Limiting 99% of my posts to pure text and links, which lowers the load on the electric grid.</li>
  <li><em>Always</em> providing an alternative text to images, for accessibility.</li>
  <li>Not using a Mastodon app on my mobile phone, just the website in Firefox.</li>
  <li>Not enabling notifications.</li>
  <li>Disabling boosts, only occasionally checking them out.</li>
  <li>Strictly avoiding the federated timeline.</li>
  <li>Enabling internal notifications (the "bell") for new posts by a super short list of people that I deeply care about, so I don't miss on what they write.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm often adjusting my follow-followers ratio, based on an ever-changing perception of other people. Unfortunately, vetting is something that needs to be done every now and then. I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231223023152/https://alirezahayati.com/2023/08/21/bugs-of-social-networks/">seriously don't care about numbers</a>, however I tend to quickly spot the borderline-broadcasters, or borderline-brands. Usually, I wait for a few weeks or months to see if they jump the shark, before unfollowing.</p>

<p>Pretty much all other social networks have nothing to do with <em>social</em>, thus don't interest me. While it's true that I still have a YouTube account, I've been using it like a TV in the 1990s, only <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/how-i-read-online/">via RSS and Pocket</a>. Focusing on fewer asynchronous and authentic interactions, and removing the obsessive checking, uploading, replying that's been the norm since the early 2000s, I achieved <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-internet-consumes-extraordinary-amounts-of-energy-heres-how-we-can-make-it-more-sustainable-160639">some needed degrowth</a>.</p>
