<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>

<p>I met Ember Rev's singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Dan Ecclestone in Cambridge through <a href="https://productionadvice.co.uk/">Ian Shepherd</a>, a friend of his. I was looking for a singer and liked his Bowie-esque timbre and approach to vocals.</p>

<p>We discussed our upcoming projects over a beer and agreed on a reciprocal collaboration. He pitched his band's next project as substantially more rock than their first album. Ian was on board as a master engineer.</p>

<p>Subtitled “a remainer’s lament for the European ideal”, <em>Premonition and Ruin</em> is an exceptional album, filled with original songs, beautifully written and arranged. Furthermore, I was excited about working with the accordion. It doesn’t happen often, and I love the instrument.</p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>

<p>When I started mixing the first song, <em>England’s Finest Hour</em>, I thought right away of spicing the accordion up, in a Gotan Project sort of style. I worked on the sound and the flow of the delay effect, ending up adding a strange electronic feel to the instrument. Logic’s automation allowed me to achieve a nice fluctuating movement.</p>

<p>For the first time, I've used my version of <a href="https://brauerizing.wordpress.com/">Michael Brauer's multi-bus compression</a>. Dan enjoyed my creative approach to mixing to the point of giving me co-producer credits.</p>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>I added the project to my Trello boards and added Dan as a contributor. We both followed the <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/project-management/">plan in real time</a> interacting through comments, links and suggestions. We met at least once a week, and the workflow went on in the smoothest possible way. Ian started his involvement with that same first song, using a mix I exported to Dropbox. I used his advice to sort a few EQ problems out.</p>

<h2 id="review">Review</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simone mixed my band’s latest two albums. I worked closely with him during this process, using his Trello-based methodology to help sequence the work. Each song appeared as a series of tasks to be completed, checked and commented on. As a result, we were able to manage our time smoothly and efficiently. Creative ideas flowed back and forth. I’m looking forward to involving him in the next recordings!

<h2 id="follow-ups">Follow-ups</h2>

<p>A year later, I ended up mixing the band’s follow-up album <a href="https://emberrev.bandcamp.com/album/from-the-country-to-the-city-to-the-sea-2"><em>From The Country To The City To The Sea</em></a>, as well as Dan’s debut solo album <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/hidden-music/"><em>Hidden Music</em></a> in January 2021.</p>
