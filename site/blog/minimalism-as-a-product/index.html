	<p>Stumbled on a "video podcast"<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by the people who call themselves <em>The Minimalists</em>. They were debating with Cal Newport about social media. I've noticed once again how almost everything that comes from the United States seems to be carrying a not-so-veiled specific <em>patina</em>. The push to self promote and sell looks relentless to me, like a prepared script. I watched the podcast and sometimes nodded in agreement — however, before I realised, I was struck with the indisputable fact that the ultimate goal seemed to package a product, or whatever that is, that could be later sold for a price.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism">Minimalism is an old concept</a>, and it's something that I've been practicing for a long time in a way or another, both in the daily life and in my work. Not the set of quasi-cultish rules these modern hipsters have carved in stone. Growing up in a poor family, I learned not to waste things, save money, reuse old stuff out of necessity, thus I've never approached minimalism from a privileged point of view. Being immersed in hyper consumeristic rituals has never been my experience.</p>

<p>The American modern version is clearly fixated on decluttering, but it also comes with a specific aesthetic. Their Instagram-perfect shots of big empty houses, proudly showing very few objects in the obligatory subdued palette, promote a way of life that looks unrealistic and fake. The fabricated social media friendly "free-in-exchange-for-your-email-address" PDF of <em>16 Rules to Declutter Your Life</em> preaches on valid principles, while seemingly reducing them to a bourgeois vision through capitalist lenses.</p>

<p>Such lifestyle is not attainable by normal people. I mean the regular folks who need to go to work, cook their food, do the laundry, maybe some gardening or else — they can't afford to spend buckets of money on few hyped products, buy coffee beans from a remote region in South America that cost half a salary at the point of sale. Above all, they cannot keep their place within a spotless private hospital aesthetic, because they <em>actually live</em> in there. They don't usually give TED talks either, especially not to promote some other form of inspirational American Dream that's great to sell another book.</p>

<p>I'd like to understand how and why I've been having this disconcerting feeling for so long. Am I that biased? When I have an exchange with someone living in the US, and I feel like the other person is <em>not</em> trying to sell me something, or subtly talking about money, their career, or ways to build up wealth, I'm positively surprised. I assume it's not a malicious behaviour, surely many Americans do that without realising. However, I think that the trend must come from an ingrained cultural root.</p>

<p>Supposedly, the entire Western civilisation is to blame, I just happen to have noticed this behaviour from a specific geographic area. For sure I've grown tired of listening to rich privileged people who can't see how transparent is their push to commercialise and make money off anything. I'll close with a quote.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a documentary about the [minimalist] movement, “bad” consumption is portrayed by masses of people swarming into big box stores on Black Friday, rushing over one another for the best deals. They are, we're led to understand, slaves to material goods, whereas the people who stay away from mass consumption are independent thinkers, free to enjoy the higher planes of life.<br />
But those people flocking to Walmart and other stores don't necessarily see things that way. To go out and purchase furniture, or an entertainment set, or a television bigger than an average computer monitor are all beyond my means. That those major sales bring the unattainable items to a level of affordability is what drives all of those people to line up and storm through doors on Black Friday.<br />
Those are people teetering on or even below the poverty level, desperate for comfort in their homes. To point to them as a reason to start an anti-consumerism movement is just another form of social shaming. Those aren't the people who would benefit from a minimalist life. They can't afford to do with less.<br />
