<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>

<p>This article reflects my own personal opinions, which are related to how I use a DAW. It’s not meant to judge any of these software. As a matter of fact, I still own and occasionally use both Logic and Pro Tools.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>After starting out with Cubase in 1995 and using it until v4, I moved to eMagic’s Logic in 2002. Transitioned to Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic Pro X</a> a bit late, I stayed there until last year. All in all, it’s been 18 years with Logic.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/daw-logic-platinum.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a version of Logic Audio Platinum 5" width="768" height="581">
<em>2002: Logic Audio Platinum 5</em></p>

<h2 id="pro-tools">Pro Tools</h2>

<p>I used plenty of other audio software over time and had always felt like Logic was never the best choice for post-production. After a problematic job, last year I finally jumped ship and paid Avid for 12 months of <a href="https://www.avid.com/pro-tools/comparison">Pro Tools subscription</a>. Despite being already familiar with the program, it substantially changed my workflow for the better.</p>

<p>I see it as a brilliant computer metaphor for someone who learned the craft in the analog world. The management of the I/O, the way it handles sends and returns, and above all, the powerful and fast audio editing. Yet, there’s something about it that always felt awkward to me. I didn’t enjoy its distinct lack of personalization, the difficult compatibility, and the unpredictability software-wise. Too many random crashes and obscure error messages that never quite stood up to its price.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/daw-protools-error.png" alt="Screenshot of an unhelpful error message in Pro Tools" width="768" height="258">
<em>Not very useful: a Pro Tools error message</em></p>

<p>Now, with my subscription about to expire, and irritated by the idea of another hefty payment during a harsh pandemic, I decided to jump ship, again.</p>

<h2 id="enter-reaper">Enter REAPER</h2>

<p>Over the past ten years, I’ve been following several professionals who switched to REAPER by Cockos. Moreover, during my recent rekindling with game audio, I’ve discovered that REAPER has become a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameAudio/comments/4wpqtt/why_is_reaper_recommended_so_much_for_game_audio/"><em>de facto</em> standard in that industry</a>.</p>

<div class="iframe-container">
	<iframe title="One of many videos about REAPER in game audio" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F2KuotvUaQU?rel=0" allow="fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
	</iframe>
</div>

<p>After the Wwise certification, learning REAPER was next in my pipeline. I thought: let’s try it now, and see if it can successfully replace Pro Tools and save me some money too.</p>

<h2 id="benefit-1-cost">Benefit 1: Cost</h2>

<p>Initially, I was seriously attracted by two factors. In order of importance:</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>The open architecture, which leads to endless customization possibilities and translates to efficiency.</li>
  <li>Cockos’ business model.</li>
</ul>

<p>REAPER is not free. The trial lasts for two months, after which the software keeps working anyway, fully functional. As Cockos says: it’s <em>up to your conscience</em>. No iLok, no authentication required. If you use the software, pay for it. They trust you to do the good thing. As a matter of fact, I tried it for about a week: that’s how long it took me to decide. There are two tiers available: <em>discounted</em> and <em>commercial</em>, depending on how you use it — a very sensible distinction.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>License</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Discounted</td>
      <td>You are an individual, and REAPER is only for your personal use, or you are an individual or business using REAPER commercially, and yearly gross revenue does not exceed USD $20,000, or you are an educational or non-profit organization.</td>
      <td><code>$60</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Commercial</td>
      <td>Every other case.</td>
      <td><code>$225</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Each license includes two major releases</strong>. For instance, I bought it now, at v6.x, which gives me free updates until v7.99 included. To put things in perspective, Logic Pro X costs <code>€199</code>, <em>no exceptions</em>. With REAPER’s discounted tier, it takes 6 major releases to reach the amount of money Apple charges. That <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REAPER#Version_history">could translate to many years</a>.</p>

<p>I won’t go down the rabbit hole of Avid’s pricing policy. As a frame of reference, Pro Tools regular is <code>€340</code> per year (including VAT). Avid also offers a “perpetual” license at <code>€682</code>: it doesn’t include all the goodies reserved to subscribers, it only comes with one year of updates and it’s so well hidden in the website I suspect they’ll remove it sooner or later. Just consider this: over the average years it takes REAPER to release two full major updates, I would have spent up to <code>€3400</code> on Pro Tools alone. Pandemic or not, I seriously struggle to see why would I want to pay that much money when I can do the same things with a different software.</p>

<h2 id="benefit-2-multi-platform">Benefit 2: Multi-platform</h2>

<p>I can install my copy of REAPER on Mac, Windows or Linux. If I need to, I can have it on all three at the same time, using the same serial I already bought.</p>

<h3 id="side-note">Side note</h3>

<p>Since the video game industry is oriented towards Windows, it’s clear to me why a multi-platform capability is one of many reasons why REAPER became a standard. Given how easy is to export and re-import all the settings and customizations, I can easily keep my setup in sync on all systems.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/daw-reaper-preferences.jpg" alt="Screenshot of REAPER’s settings window, where it's possible to export the whole configuration" width="768" height="513">
<em>Import and export REAPER’s configuration</em></p>

<h3 id="tracks">Tracks</h3>

<p>This was a biggie for me. I was stunned to discover that REAPER doesn’t have track types. In other words: it’s <em>track agnostic</em>. Despite an initial WTF moment, I’m now absolutely in love with the concept. In all the other DAWs I know, when I create new tracks I must <em>at least</em> select a type, along with some other information. Usually, a choice is requested to set the track as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Audio</li>
  <li>External MIDI</li>
  <li>Virtual MIDI instrument</li>
  <li>Auxiliary bus</li>
  <li>VCA</li>
  <li>Mono</li>
  <li>Stereo</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/daw-pro-tools-new-tracks.gif" alt="Screenshot of a Pro Tools window where it’s possible to create new tracks" width="720" height="432">
<em>Create new tracks in Pro Tools</em></p>

<em>Create new tracks in Logic Pro X</em></p>

<p>Imagine having to double click in the track area and not worry about any of the above. Since <em>a track is just a track</em>, I can decide later on its routing based on what I need. Of course, I can add multiple tracks at once and more if I want, but the basic action is built for speed.</p>

<p>As for pretty much everything in REAPER, a track can be created in three ways: double click in the track area; keyboard shortcut; right-click in the track area (opens a contextual menu with more options).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/daw-reaper-create-new-tracks.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a REAPER menu for creating new tracks" width="694" height="372">
<em>REAPER: create new track(s)</em></p>

<p>Drag an audio file, whether mono, stereo or multichannel, and the track accepts it; do the same by dropping a MIDI file. It also doesn’t care if the audio files are at different sample rates. Later, you can decide if it has to be mono or stereo, assign outputs and/or sends and whatnot. Also, and this is utterly cool: I can have a mono audio, a stereo (or surround) audio and a MIDI sequence all in one track:</p>

<figure class="fullscreen">

	<figcaption>Reaper is track-type agnostic</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s a different metaphor, and it leads to a whole new workflow. It’s become an unbelievably efficient timesaver to me. Reproducing all my Logic or Pro Tools templates, including creating groups of track presets first, only took a few minutes.</p>

<h3 id="routing">Routing</h3>

<p>There are several ways to manipulate the signal flow. Each one serves a purpose depending on the situation. For instance, clicking the route icon in a track the following appears:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/daw-reaper-routing-track.png" alt="Screenshot of the routing window in REAPER" width="768" height="291">
<em>The routing window from a track in REAPER</em></p>

<p>For sends and returns, I can either use the basic routing window pictured above, or drag the route icon from one track onto another: the cursor changes into a patch cable, symbolizing the connection.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/daw-reaper-drag-send.png" alt="Screenshot of a track control panel in REAPER, where a red arrow shows the drag path from a track to another, in order to create a send" width="768" height="692">
<em>Create a send from one track to another by dragging the route icon (“IO” in my skin) to a track</em></p>

<p>I can also select multiple tracks at once, hold SHIFT and drag from the same icon to re-route them all. Technically, all these actions create a bus/aux, but again, I don’t have to worry about it. I usually assign a custom colour to my busses so that they’re easily recognizable, and work it out later.</p>

<p>The fastest way to create a bus is to create a folder. It’s as easy as clicking the folder icon in the track: the ones below will indent and be instantly re-routed. Once a folder is created, a "ghost clip" is generated at the top level, so that when the folder is collapsed its content is still visible.</p>

<figure class="fullscreen">
	<img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/daw-reaper-folder.png" alt="Screenshot of a track control panel section in REAPER, showing a folder with its ghost clip at the top" width="768" height="183" />
	<figcaption>A folder in REAPER, with its ghost clip at the top</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The routing matrix window can be used to apply elaborated signal flows to the whole song. As an example, I always send my mix to four groups (see: <a href="https://brauerizing.wordpress.com/">Brauerizing</a>) depending on the material; these A to D groups feed a mix bus where I apply my top-level processing.</p>

<p>Finally, it goes to the master output which holds meter readings. In addition, I have my external DAC for headphones, routed to output 7-8 of my interface. I can do all this <em>in seconds</em>, as demonstrated by Kenny Gioia in the following video:</p>

<div class="iframe-container">
	<iframe title="Video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oAfF6lNlMQk?rel=0" allow="fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
	</iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="grouping">Grouping</h3>

<p>Similarly to Pro Tools, I can group tracks together, for mixing or editing. However, REAPER supports <em>temporary groups</em> too, as Logic does. Select multiple tracks, quickly manipulate them — volume, pan, solo, mute, etc — and unselect to go back to normal. It works in the track panel as well as in the mixer, and it’s awesome.</p>

<p>Same as for the routing, there is a grouping matrix window, where more complex connections can be applied quickly to the entire project.</p>
