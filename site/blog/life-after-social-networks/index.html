	<p>At the beginning of August 2020 I <a href="/blog/escape-from-social-media/">deleted all my social media accounts</a>, except for YouTube. So, how has it been? I never intended to make a living solely through the music I write: my work in sound design and production is in a different business. Had I read <a href="https://www.stevelawson.net/2021/08/keeping-your-soul-in-an-algorithmic-world/">this post by Steve Lawson</a> post in 2019, it would have pushed me to consider a few things.</p>

<p>I don’t judge people that are still juggling with social networks, yet I see any lucubration about how to stay in mainstream social media and save the soul as <em>plain weird</em>. I suppose once you’re out you can’t really understand why anyone would want to continue staying locked in — like an ex-smoker. Having lived through the full experience of being engulfed in social networks, I know what Steve’s talking about. However, after leaving pretty much everything in the last couple of years, including Apple's walled garden, I’ve never felt more liberated and light-weight.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened-after-i-left-social-media">What happened after I left social media</h2>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>I suddenly gained what still seems like an insane amount of free time.</li>
  <li>My work has massively improved, becoming more productive and focused.</li>
  <li>I started reading again without interruptions.</li>
  <li>I caught up with things I’d been leaving behind because I didn’t feel like I had the time or the required focus.</li>
  <li>I learned to use Pro Tools, then after a few months <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/">ditched it and learned REAPER</a>.</li>
  <li>I studied Wwise and FMOD (video game audio authoring).</li>
  <li>I expanded my knowledge of new web dev technologies, migrating two websites from WordPress to Jekyll and from a traditional hosting to Netlify, saving money in the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Above all, I stopped caring about whatever CEO billionaire do or say, while following savvy people who write about facts, productivity and tech whilst keeping a critical eye on all things related to the so-called “surveillance capitalism”.</p>

<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>

<p>I can understand the argument about having an <em>audience</em> (though <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/de-brand/">I dislike the term</a>), and I get people when they tell me they can’t leave a particular social network because of the relationships they built there. Yet, my escape pushed me to actually speak to the people I used to hang around on those networks. I got in touch, asked for their emails and sometimes their phone numbers.</p>

<p>I now talk to them asynchronously and it feels genuine, real. We have stuff to discuss about, without the usual <em>oh yeah, I saw it earlier on Facebook</em>. I nurtured my email newsletter and stayed in touch with a larger amount of people than expected through either email, newsletters, RSS and sometimes Telegram or Signal. Finally, if my contacts came from <a href="https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, I followed them there. The vast majority of people who left social media reports the very same conclusions.</p>

<h2 id="what-if">What if?</h2>

<p>On the other hand, I can’t understand how people actually enjoy having their time, attention and focus snatched by young-white-male-dominated mega corporations. Especially knowing how they make their money through selling personal data, reprogramming the social behaviour of millions while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hack">altering entire democracies</a> in the making. I keep asking: what if these soulless machines stopped working? We all remember the fast demise of MySpace; what would happen to that <em>audience amplifier</em>? My answer was, and still is: have your own space <a href="https://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html">on the internet</a>.</p>

<aside class="warning">
  <p><strong>Edit, 10 March 2022</strong>. I re-joined <a href="https://mastodon.help/">Mastodon</a>, as an experiment. I did try it in 2017, to no avail. I now immediately understood why everyone says <em>it's not Twitter</em>. It sure feels like a totally different space.</p>
