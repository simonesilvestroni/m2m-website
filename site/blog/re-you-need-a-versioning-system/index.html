	<p>Jamie Hill <a href="https://jamieslist.deptofenergymgmt.com/p/you-need-a-versioning-system">argues for a backup system</a>, and rightly so. Although his post outlines the exact same manual, effective, simple methodology I'd been using for many years, I felt compelled to write down a reply with my current procedure. Disclaimer: while Jamie uses Pro Tools, his way can be indeed applied to every <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr>, while mine is exclusively related to <abbr title="Rapid Environment for Audio Production, Engineering and Recording">REAPER</abbr>. Two years after my <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/daw-from-logic-to-pro-tools-to-reaper-part-1/">switch from Pro Tools</a>, I keep finding improvements to my workflow, and this is one of them. What I'm currently doing to save multiple progressive versions of my work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I hit <kbd>⌘&nbsp;S</kbd> (<kbd>⌃&nbsp;S</kbd> on Windows and Linux).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>That's it</em>. Under the hood, REAPER is saving a new version of the project, adding an automatic increment number to the filename. REAPER's actions panel is where the magic happens:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reaper-saveasnewproject.png" alt="Screenshot of the action panel in Reaper, with the File: Save new version of project action selected" width="1024" height="698">
<em>The action panel in Reaper</em></p>

<p>All I had to do was finding the correct action (or build a custom one if nobody thought of it), and add the shortcut usually associated to saving a project. I'm <em>de facto</em> hijacking the "save" command here. The result is that every time a session is saved, the project changes its filename, while the previous one stays in the same folder as a backup. Granted, I can end up with a large number of files, but that's fine: they don't weigh much, plus I take care of moving the versions to my backup sub-folder at the end of a work day.</p>

<p>If this is not ideal, a good alternative is the technique I'd been using until a few months ago: REAPER's automatic backup system. It's in the preferences:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/reaper-projectsettings-backup.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the preference window in Reaper, where the field 'Save to timestamped file' is circled in red" width="1024" height="675">
<em>Reaper preferences window</em></p>

<p>The pros of this second method are clear: the software takes care of both the versioning <em>and</em> moving the backups in a sub-folder. Why did I switch? Because I want to determine the point of a new version when I save the session, which is when a substantial change that needs preserving has happened. A method based on <em>x minutes</em> doesn't mean much to me.</p>
