	<p>This is not my first foray into the unintended consequences of a past decision that's affecting my present. I'm not again onto why I left the UK to "temporarily stay in Italy" until COVID is over — I'm thinking of a specific chain of events caused by a life choice from several years ago.</p>

<p>I take pride in considering myself a digital polymath. I know it’s not a rare occurrence in modern life — it doesn’t take a savant to become one these days — yet, I’ve always put a lot of effort trying to excel in my eclectic interests. I fuelled career leaps (music, video games sound design, with print design and web development as intermittent side hustles) by channelling the pleasure of <em>feeling proficient</em> in something that I enjoy doing.</p>

<p>I spent decades fighting tooth and nail against whomever labelled me a <em>jack of all trades, master of none</em>. The fact that — besides my encyclopedic knowledge of Pink Floyd, or a quirky talent in recognising typefaces by just looking at them — I struggle to consider myself a <em>proper expert</em> feels problematic at this moment in life. I like <a href="https://kevquirk.com/the-expert-vs-the-impostor">not being alone in this</a> though.</p>

<p>Leaping from one career to the next, while helping build personality and bring a wider range of high level experiences, had one slighlty unsavoury consequence. I've always needed to counterbalance creative activities with something deeply technical. To function at my best, I need both freedom of expression and a solid set of rules — something that's not easy to find within a single gig. Except for the one that I'd decided to leave in 2006: video games.</p>

<p>I've been ruminating for days on what could have been, had I not left. It's a job that entails what I love the most: sound, storytelling, intelligent escapism, positive stimuli, exciting technical challenges, problem solving. I actually pioneered <em>modern</em> game audio — at least in my more or less backward home country — juggling team leader duties with intense audio work. I learned the process of integrating an adaptive soundtrack within a custom in-house 3D engine, in 2001. I created sound effects using field recording and libraries, implementing them in rudimental audio middleware, whether that be the in-house editor or the first Xbox and PlayStation 2 <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr>s. Optimise sounds within the reach of each platform limitations was no joke. All the while dealing with meetings, and managing a team in a dysfunctional work environment. No webinars back then: only thick printed manuals, and the annual Game Developer Conference.</p>

<p>Of course, that caused burnout, and a desire to leave. Understandable, but naive. I could have had <em>two decades of major experience</em> in the field, which would have likely meant being able to work anywhere I wanted. Instead of basking in the glory of being present on the day that Valve unveiled Steam at the 2002 GDC, I now could have been <em>teaching</em> Audiokinetic Wwise instead of learning it.</p>

<p>I guess it all boils down to this: while I might be struggling to go back to game audio after such a hiatus, my plan B as a web developer is not ironclad. With my dislike of Javascript and the current trend of bloated websites, I could be <a href="https://helloyes.dev/blog/2022/mourning-my-obsolete-skillset/">edging irrelevancy</a>. Similarly, I should promote the shit out of my music producer skills in a terribly saturated sector, where the path to succeed is intertwined with an uncanny ability to be a noisy and relentless social media marketing brand machine — something that I really cannot and <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/de-brand/">don't want to be</a>. If I'm being honest, I'd rather devote my music producer capacity to side projects.</p>

<h2 id="edit-two-replies">Edit: two replies</h2>

<p>I love receiving replies in the form of posts on personal websites. Wouter Groeneveld argues about the downsides of <a href="https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/07/being-a-generalist-in-a-specialist-world/">being a generalist in a specialist world</a>, which of course touched on many points I share with him. Matthew Greybosch is facing my issue from an opposite perspective, and outlines the frustrations of being stuck in a thankless job by using the fitting metaphor of <a href="https://old.starbreaker.org/blog/cathedrals-on-quicksand/index.html">building cathedrals on quicksand</a>.</p>
