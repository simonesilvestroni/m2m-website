<h2 id="about-amuse">About Amuse</h2>

<p>Founded in 2015, Amuse is dedicated to producing and distributing kids' content across digital platforms. Located in the heart of Paris, their team of artists &amp; animators, writers, developers and executives collaborate everyday to produce &amp; distribute great shows throughout the world.</p>

<h2 id="initial-test">Initial test</h2>

<p>HR contacted me through <a href="https://soundlister.com/portfolio/simone-silvestroni/">SoundLister</a>, explaining the type of job and the fact it would be fully remote. They also sent a 36-seconds long test to be completed for the following week — which I did, successfully.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/carcity-test-logic.jpg" alt="Logic project for my initial test of Car City: Tom the Tow Truck" width="1024" height="604">
<em>Logic project for my initial test of Car City: Tom the Tow Truck</em></p>

<h2 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h2>

<p>For the straightforward process, I signed up for an account on their own online production management platform called <em>Scale3</em>, joined their Slack, read a single induction document explaining the procedure from start to delivery, along with a set of specifications and how to file an invoice.</p>

<h2 id="project-management">Project management</h2>

<p>The company adopts agile processes to ensure a steady production schedule. The job started before the pandemic and continued during the first lockdowns in Europe. I interacted with the project manager through Slack. All the episodes of <em>Car City</em> in production were listed in the system, along with features such as state of completion, deadlines and the required documentation.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-storage">Cloud storage</h2>

<p>I had access to a cloud storage, where a certain amount of audio libraries created by Amuse were available to download and use. These included all the characters voices, reusable sounds and many car-related effects. While I was bound to use their characters libraries, they let me free to use whatever I wanted for the rest, so I ended up using a mix of both.</p>

<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>

<p>I chose to book tasks based on the type of story and the fun I thought I would get from their complexity. The working materials were downloadable from each episode's page: the pre-recorded voice-over in <code>.wav</code> format, along with the screenplay and a description of the general requirements.</p>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>Once I familiarized with the screenplay and the silent video animation, my go-to actions were:</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>Open the template in Logic Pro</li>
  <li>Drag the video into the timeline</li>
  <li>Create markers with the first obvious cues, such as the reusable scenes</li>
  <li>Drag and precisely position audio files for the reusable scenes and the voice-overs, following the screenplay document</li>
</ul>

<p>Then it was a matter of following the story and create the sound design for the rest of the movie. I kept an iPad as an external monitor, to always have the video on its own. I didn't use plug-ins except for impulse response reverbs, though I did rely a lot functionalities such as gain, pan, and a whole lot of automation.</p>

<h2 id="delivery">Delivery</h2>

<p>Amuse requested the following specifications:</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<ul>
  <li>File format: <code>.wav</code></li>
  <li>Stereo</li>
  <li>48kHz, 24 bits</li>
  <li>No dithering</li>
  <li>Audio files with voice over (English)</li>
  <li>Audio files without voice over (mute)</li>
  <li>True peak: <code>–1 dB</code></li>
  <li>Loudness integrated target: <code>–16 dB LUFS</code> (+/-1 dB margin)</li>
  <li>Dynamic range: <code>&gt; 9 LU</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video">Video</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>25 fps</code></li>
  <li>HDV</li>
  <li><code>1280*720p</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Once the mix was finalized and uploaded, the project manager would listen to it and send their feedback. I would receive a message on Slack, along with the possibility of having a discussion or asking for further explanations. Once all the edits requested in the feedback were completed and a sign-off was obtained, I would proceed to master the audio  and export the video following the guidelines. The task would be marked as complete, usually in less than an hour.</p>

<h2 id="release">Release</h2>

<p>The episodes were released on several networks, such as YouTube, Apple TV+ and others, following a specific schedule, usually a couple of weeks after delivery.</p>
