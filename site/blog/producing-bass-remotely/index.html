</div>

<p>The following analysis was written in June 2020, based on my work for <a href="https://antiquity-music.com/">Antiquity</a> and their single <em>The Far Side Of The Sun</em>. They are based in New York, while I had been living in the UK at the time.</p>

<h2 id="stage-1-assessment">Stage 1: Assessment</h2>

<p>Regardless if I have an established working relationship with the client, I start with a proper assessment of the material. I listen to the song and have a chat with them. It’s useful to ask for the kind of <em>mood</em> they’re after; or if they have creative ideas about the bass line.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this preliminary work is all about finding out the best way to deliver what the client needs. When I first listen to the audio, I tend to form an idea in my mind. It’s not a defined bass part yet, but sketches who often end up in the final bass track.</p>

<h3 id="the-source-material">The Source Material</h3>

<p>The more technical aspect of the assessment is obtaining the source material. Sometimes clients send just a rough mix of the track in a single audio file. In this case, I need to have some information:</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>The BPM of the song.</li>
  <li>The SMPTE and <code>fps</code> settings in their DAW project. I need to import the rough mix in my session and avoid audio drifting because of synchronisation issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the client’s level of expertise, I might need to point out a few best practices. I email them a <em>how-to</em> in PDF format, highlighting the fastest and best way to get their project to me.</p>

<h3 id="the-session">The Session</h3>

<p>Since I’ve been working with Gerald for a while, we’ve already established a routine. He sends a Logic Pro session with the following:</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>Markers. Although optional, it's a great visual help to quickly scan the song structure.</li>
  <li>MIDI virtual instruments bounced to audio.</li>
  <li>Audio rendered with all his plug-ins processing already applied.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the client has a test track for the bass, it’s sufficient a rough mix with and without it. However, the possibility of taking the volume of groups of instruments up or down is a great help. Typically, I might want to increase the level of drums and percussions, to help with my recording.</p>

<p>When I receive a session, I can decide whether to keep the original format or move it to Reaper. Sometimes I work in Logic for the sake of speed.</p>

<h2 id="stage-2-recording">Stage 2: Recording</h2>

<p>I don’t have a standard on how many takes I record. My rule is: <em>as many takes as I need</em>. Even if I feel a take is good from start to end, I keep going for a couple more. I might come up with different or more interesting riffs or variations.</p>

<p>Whenever I’m sure about a good take, I write down its number. I might refer to it as the <em>default</em> later in the comping phase. I occasionally might want to take breaks or even stop working on the track altogether until the day after. The advantage of this approach is fresh ears and a more open vision.</p>

<p>I record the bass through a SansAmp BassDriver DI v2, rarely applying a software pre-amp or amp simulators.</p>

<h2 id="stage-3-comping">Stage 3: Comping</h2>

<p>I’m an exception to the rule <em>the first take is always the best</em>. I tend to see the early attempts as rehearsals. I rarely do punch-ins. If I make an unrecoverable mistake, unless there’s something I really want to keep, I stop and delete. I always start with a default good take, using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/9zyld5BicWQ">takes</a> in Reaper</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.avid.com/resource-center/whats-new-in-pro-tools">playlists</a> in Pro Tools</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.macprovideo.com/article/logic-pro/heres-how-to-quickly-comp-audio-takes-in-logic-pro-x">comp edit</a> in Logic</li>
</ul>

<p>In Pro Tools I can select a section and quickly swap between takes in loop mode using a keyboard shortcut. The comp is done on the whole track, moving forward from start to end. I check each section of the song, following the markers. I always remember where I played interesting riffs, so I tend to primarily focus on those. When needed, I record a punch-in to fix minor problems.</p>

<p>The final step is listening to the track in context with the mix. If I’m happy with the result I commit to audio, hiding and deactivating the source in case I want to go back and tweak something.</p>

<h2 id="stage-4-editing">Stage 4: Editing</h2>

<p>After enabling <a href="https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/home-page/2017/5/25/free-puremix-tutorial-how-to-use-elastic-audio-in-pro-tools">elastic audio</a> in Pro Tools (monophonic, real-time processing), I go in and adjust the transient sensitivity. I want to get to a point where only the correct hits are detected. It’s the best way to avoid irritating artifacts. This is especially useful with a fretless bass.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/protools-elasticaudio-monophonic-minutes-to-midnight.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Pro Tools' elastic audio algorithm options" width="720" height="510">
<em>Pro Tools algorithm options for elastic audio</em></p>

<p>After switching the track view to <code>Analysis</code>, excessive transients that might have slipped through the previous step are removed, then in <code>Warp</code> view I check if there are obvious mistakes in the timing. Working in grid mode makes it easy to see which notes are off. I tend to only adjust what's obviously out of place, rather than generically quantize.</p>

<p>In case I decide to go for an automated process, I never go beyond an 82% clean-up. I prefer to <em>retain the human factor</em> with my playing. In the video below, you can see a single automatic audio quantize to a specific small selection played as triplets, and a couple of notes adjusted.</p>

<p>Finally, I switch elastic audio to <code>X-Form</code>. As a high-quality process, it is a <em>rendering-only mode</em>. The result is always satisfying to my ears. Once again, I commit the audio to a new track, and hide/disable the source.</p>

<h2 id="stage-5-mix">Stage 5: Mix</h2>

<h3 id="eq">EQ</h3>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>I usually focus on the relationship between kick and bass. After working out the fundamental of the kick I try to scoop out that same frequency from the bass, usually in sidechain.</li>
  <li>Since I use a 4-string instrument, I remove the deepest sub-bass with a high-pass filter.</li>
  <li>Adding <em>harmonic enhancing</em> is usually the most efficient way for the bass guitar to be heard on smaller speakers such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops. I mostly use Waves's <em>RBass</em> for the task.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compression">Compression</h3>

<p>Not a fan of compressing the source channel, except for when there are extreme peaks or dips. In some cases, Pro Tools’ <code>clip gain</code> gets the job done. I prefer compression as a parallel process, oftentimes adopting multiple parallel processes through several busses. After applying different flavours of gentle to more drastic compression, I blend all the signals together. My plug-in staples are:</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>1176 (black)</li>
  <li>LA-2A</li>
  <li>A third of my choice depending on the sound and the interpretation I want to convey:
    <ul>
      <li>H-comp or LA-3A by Waves.</li>
      <li>Distressor, emulated by McDSP.</li>
      <li>Decapitator by Soundtoys. As a matter of fact, saturation is a process I pretty much always apply, mildly and in parallel, unless the song requires a properly distorted bass.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once I'm happy with compression, I add a Pultec to the final bass track.</p>

<h3 id="sends">Sends</h3>

<p>Although I’ve applied both reverb and delay to the bass on a <a href="https://minutestomidnight.bandcamp.com/track/requiem">song contained in my recent album <em>After 1989</em></a>, I usually never do. I prefer to add spacing effects only if the instrument is performing an important melodic function. In the aforementioned song, there's a synth bass audible in the second half. It's my Warwick played with a pick, passed through a stutter effect, a phaser, a panner and a delay.</p>

<h2 id="stage-6-delivery">Stage 6: Delivery</h2>

<p>When it comes to delivery, it all depends on what the client had sent to me. If I received a simple stereo audio file, I reciprocate by sending a mono track with my bass. The true peak is between <code>–3</code> and <code>–6 dB</code> with an RMS of about <code>–12 dB</code>. No matter when my part starts, I always export the audio <em>from the very beginning of the session</em>.</p>

<p>With Antiquity I bounce the bass from Pro Tools and import in the original Logic song. I give it a final listen: if it sounds good, I copy the session to Dropbox. In the video example below, I’ve found the track to be too <em>hot</em> (but not clipping), so I proceeded to reduce the gain directly in Logic.</p>

<p>Optimising is paramount. To deliver a clean session I export a new copy cleaning up any unused or deactivated tracks. I <em>never deliver a session with my takes</em>, comp or edits: only the mixdown.</p>

<h2 id="stage-7-feedback-from-the-client">Stage 7: Feedback from the client</h2>

<p>Unless I’m working on a larger project, for which I use my <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/project-management/">Trello system</a>, I have a practical way for the client to give feedback on my mixes. If they have a Dropbox account I send a direct link: they can listen and add comments that would be attached to the correct position in the song timeline. It’s the same behaviour as in SoundCloud’s comment system.</p>

<h2 id="client-review">Client review</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve worked with Simone on both my projects and his and the professionalism and quality of his work is world class. I have rarely had to give direction and he takes direction like an interested pro. I’m very partial to his style and tone. I hope to be still playing with him in the years to come. If you want a bass track that stands out and makes people sit up and listen, Simone is your man.
