	<p>After deleting an old WordPress account last week, I opened my Bitwarden password vault to check on the preposterous number of login entries — around 460. Inspired by the <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com">Google Graveyard</a>, I started a side project: collecting names of major corporations that I've had an account with for years, and that I want to rid of.</p>

<p>Not going to list <em>all</em> the two hundreds and fifty accounts that I've erased, nor complain about the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/byzantine">bizantine</a> manoeuvres put in place by corporations in order to prevent people from leaving — that's their problem. Far from being yet another frustrated post on the growth-at-all-costs culture of the capitalistic internet, I want to briefly analyse a few deletions, and why they helped me feeling lighter and quieter.</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<p>Nobody have ever reached out by saying they were interested in knowing more, after finding my music on <em>Spotify</em>. Since this is by design, I removed all the music and deleted both my personal and artist accounts. Same as with <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/leaving-soundcloud/"><em>SoundCloud</em></a>, it feels pointless to scatter songs over centralised online silos. The sanest direction of travel from now on is to follow the principles of <a href="https://beyourownplatform.site">#BeYourOwnPlatform</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-large-ones">The large ones</h2>

<p>I stopped ruminating over my past participation with large conglomerates. I'm just glad that now I don't get noise from <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Instagram</em>, <em>Twitter</em>, <em>Reddit</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Microsoft</em>, and <em>Adobe</em>. Happy about not spreading <em>Mailchimp</em> tracking codes into people's inboxes, I've never went anywhere near <em>Substack</em> either. Once I manage to refurbish my Android phone with an independent <em>Google</em>-free ROM, I'm also gonna axe the ex-search-now-ads giant.</p>

<h2 id="automattic">Automattic</h2>

<p>Four years ago, when I decided to leave WordPress, I didn't do it in spite of any company shenanigans: I simply wanted to simplify my personal site. While it's true that I've never liked its CEO and co-founder, the recent pile-up of multiple controversies pushed me to delete accounts with <em>wordpress.com</em>, <em>wordpress.org</em>, <em>PocketCast</em>, and consequently the now useless <em>WP Rocket</em> and <em>Yoast</em>. <em>Tumblr</em> had been in the graveyard for some time.</p>

<h2 id="vc-funded-vultures">VC-funded vultures</h2>

<p>Cut ties with <em>Uber</em>, <em>Netlify</em>, <em>AirBnB</em>, <em>Cloudflare</em>, <em>Zapier</em>, and many more.</p>

<h2 id="the-pointless-ones">The pointless ones</h2>

<p>Whether because they don't make sense to me anymore, or due to some enlightened management decision to follow the AI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley problem</a>, I quit holding hands with <em>Mozilla</em>, <em>Deviantart</em>, <em>Stack Overflow</em>, <em>Atlassian</em>, <em>Trello</em>, <em>Discord</em>, <em>Eventbrite</em>, <em>Meetup</em>, <em>Figma</em>, <em>Klarna</em>, <em>Patreon</em>, <em>Vimeo</em>, <em>WeTransfer</em>.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>The above amounts to a tiny percentage of the culling. A sheer number of deletions are confined in the extremely fragmented world of sound design. Every single audio plug-in depends on an inefficient online account, whether the software is paid or free, so I moved away from that world a while ago, to consolidate my efforts around a few tiny (and one big) companies.</p>

<p>A heartfelt mention of honour goes to <em>Avid</em>. The privacy request I sent on 4 December 2023 through their official privacy channel still has to be processed. Two months later I asked what the wait was for, so they assigned a request ID to my reply, answering after a week by saying "This is a duplicate question about a previous request". I'll wait.</p>
