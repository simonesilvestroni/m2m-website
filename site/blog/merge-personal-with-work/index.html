<p>After an inconclusive poll on Mastodon, where the question ‘<em>should I merge my work and personal websites or leave them separate?</em>’ produced a perfect 50% split, I had decided to merge. My goal was to represent the fact that I'm a person with interests that comprise — and at the same time go beyond — any side of myself. I absolutely didn't want to go back to projecting a <em>personal brand</em>, nor hide the fact that I have an eclectic professional life.</p>

<p>My solution was to keep the <em>personal</em> approach dominant. After porting all the case studies over from my web development work site, I created two landing pages, one for each professional side: <a href="https://sound.minutestomidnight.co.uk">sound design</a> and <a href="https://dev.minutestomidnight.co.uk">web development</a>. Structured as proper CVs,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> they live in subdomains, allowing me to send a single link to recruiters or whoever might be interested in the minutiae of my work life.</p>

<p>I've come to detest personal websites that look like a business card, where the owner's job role is shouted in gigantic typefaces on a full-screen "hero header". Marketing lingo<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> coupled with corporate-like design are creeping up everywhere on the internet, and I want to stay out of it. My website continues to be personal, while still offering ways to find out what I do for work. By refusing to cater for a specific category of people, I'm trying to keep it true to who <em>I am</em>, and what <em>I do</em>, without thinking if that should represent a public persona or not.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://kwon.nyc/notes/which-self-is-this/"><em>Which self is this?</em> by Rachel Kwon</a>, and while I understand the fundamental question underlining the post, my way out is to embrace the <em>wholeness</em>.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>Work-related posts have several point of entry, without being accessible from the main navigation. To reinforce the concept of <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/about/">duality that has always accompanied me</a>, all the case studies, redesigned and optimised, are now regular <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/">blog posts</a>.</p>

<p>Soundcloud and personal YouTube embeds have been replaced by standard HTML <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> objects. Having already wiped out a large amount of unwanted third-party bloat, I'm going to keep going by replacing the remaining YouTube videos with equivalent from Invidious instances.</p>

<p>Both primary and secondary navigation have been simplified, with some pages deleted or consolidated. I removed the last remnants of the <em>personal brand</em> era from most places, especially in the now rewritten <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/about/">About page</a>. With that, a gigantic amount of more or less obvious tautology is also gone.</p>

<p>Jekyll has been updated and optimised, with fewer dependencies and include modules. Both layouts and stylesheets are sensibly improved, with a reduced number of classes to clutter the markup.</p>

<p>Reintroduced a minimalistic implementation of <em>parasocial</em> Open Graph meta tags, as suggested by <a href="https://actualwebsite.org/index.html#fn6">Matthew Graybosch</a>. While testing the results, I'd decided to re-check the whole site with <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx, a text-only browser</a> that doesn't support neither CSS nor javascript. It made me notice a silly but embarrassing bug, now fixed.</p>

<p>Finally, I temporarily removed the automatic switch to dark mode. I wasn't enjoying it myself, so I made the background less bright while still keeping a triple-A contrast for accessibility. The idea of an optional toggle for the dual colour theme is still there, however it's low priority right now.</p>
