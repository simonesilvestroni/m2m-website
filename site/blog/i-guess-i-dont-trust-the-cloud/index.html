	<p>I basically use <em>zero</em> cloud systems, even though I was an eager early adopter, because of the following reasons:</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>I inherently don't trust any of the suppliers, in terms of security, surveillance, and the uncomfortable feeling of <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/08/08/another-user-locked-out-of-apple-account/">depending on some distant corporation for accessing my files</a>.</li>
  <li>A string of bad experiences — data loss, mostly.</li>
  <li>A complete hatred for the amount of data transferred, which has a snowballing effect on <a href="https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/the-cloud-is-material/release/1">how much electricity is consumed</a>.</li>
  <li>I'm not <em>constantly</em> connected to the internet, neither I want to, so having files locally available at all times is paramount.</li>
  <li>I don't actually need a cloud.</li>
</ul>

<p>I removed any data from iCloud and other services a few years ago. I still have a free Dropbox account with 7.5 GB of space, only used to share music material with a couple collaborators, three or four times a year. Since I don't want to get near their awful desktop client, <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> on the Mac is the perfect tool to manage those files.</p>

<p>To keep a few relevant files in sync between devices (a Mac and an Android phone), plus a folder shared with my wife, I use the open source <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. The only other two things that I actually need are address book and calendar, a feature easily achieved through <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/email-migration-from-proton-to-mailbox/">Mailbox.org's calDAV and cardDAV</a>.</p>

<p>I don't stream music. We use a local music library on a fast <abbr title="Solid State Drive">SSD</abbr>, shared using our old Airport Extreme. Whenever I want some music on the go, I just connect my phone to the Mac and use <a href="https://mac.eltima.com/file-manager.html">Commander One</a> to copy whatever I fancy listening to. Had I not needed two SIMs, I would have probably cloned the entire library on an <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card.</p>

<p>To reiterate, I seriously don't want anything else synced between computer and smartphone. I'm aware that I too fell victim to the induced need to have <em>everything</em> with me at all times — not anymore. Why should I carry <a href="https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/03/continuous-productivity-is-toxic/">a productivity system</a> in my pocket? Yet another toxic habit that I happily ditched. I'd rather play a video game while on a train trip, maybe read an article or two, send a couple messages. If I really have to jot down something while on the go, I'll open a text editor and write, or better: take a note with pen and paper. No need for a cloud, especially one that I don't own or control.</p>

<h2 id="a-word-on-backup">A word on backup</h2>

<p>After a few years using Backblaze as a cloud-based off-site backup failsafe, I quit six months ago, so I'm back to keeping all my backups <em>local</em>. Following a <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/backup-and-audio-archival/">3-2-1 rule</a>, the third complete set of backup is indeed off-site, meaning it's temporarily hosted at a friend's house. As soon as we re-settle in the UK, we might rent a safety box. It'll cost more than Backblaze, but it'll be available at a bike ride's distance.</p>
