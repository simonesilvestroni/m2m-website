	<p>This post is a personal point of view, it’s not intended as an exhaustive analysis on what is going on with social media, nor am I trying to convince anybody to do the same. I’m just redirecting my attention and my time to something more productive.</p>

<p><strong>Addiction</strong>. I believe the term <em>social media</em> is an oxymoron. Besides a toxicity that has reached a point of no return, there's the deliberate addictive mechanisms and the self-declared aim to hog our time as much as they can. The massive problem with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">personal data</a> is even beyond the point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thought process was all about: how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible? This means we had to give you a dopamine hit every once in a while.
<cite>Sean Parker (former Facebook president)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hate</strong>. The relentless promotion of hateful content such as misogyny, homophobia, racism, and more. The thick <a href="https://youtu.be/VK6_tjizu_g">keyboard warriors</a> peddling debunked conspiracies all day long and getting rewarded for doing that — I’m talking about holocaust deniers, and a multitude of other dangerous idiocy. Not to mention the sheer amount of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/26/yael-eisenstat-facebook-is-ripe-for-manipulation-and-viral-misinformation">highly controversial and polarizing material</a>. It’s infuriating to the point of leaving me <em>angry all day long</em>. I also don’t want to examine the depressing long list of accusations of <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/11/16/564542100/how-disinformation-and-distortions-on-social-media-affected-elections-worldwide">altering the course of major elections</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Focus</strong>. I used to be an avid reader and writer. Over the last ten years, both activities have reduced to a bare minimum. The decision of leaving has been brewing for a long while. Because of the release of my concept album last year, I deluded myself into thinking that riding the social media train was right. I have no idea about whether or not that was a good idea, the crucial point is how I allowed myself to be <em>blackmailed into staying put</em>.</p>

<p>Listen to Sean Parker (former Facebook president) and Chamath Palihapitiya (former early senior executive at Facebook): a <a href="https://youtu.be/J54k7WrbfMg">spine-chilling discussion</a> about how Facebook, and by extension social media, was designed to be as addictive as it could, and is now ripping society apart.</p>

<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>

<p>At the moment, I’m back to the roots: blogging again, while interacting with others like I used to do for most of the 2000s. It’s one of many direct ways to establish a connection with friends and strangers alike. When I want to know what other people are up to, I reach out by email or text, I sign up to their newsletter. I’m having actual conversations. Imagine watching a sunset without having the urge to take a picture or think about hashtags. Or attending a live concert and avoid shooting pointless videos and photos to simply enjoy the spectacle. You get the gist.</p>

<p><strong>What about business?</strong> If anyone is in a similar situation as mine — a professional freelance — I’m sorry I don’t have a recipe. What I’ve done so far is stop pretending that social media <em>must be</em> essential to my career. I’m trying to build stronger relationships in the real world instead, by reaching out directly. Corporations handling and centralising all my communications is not a good thing: I quit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/learning/are-you-the-same-person-on-social-media-as-you-are-in-real-life.html">curating a fake persona</a> that has no connection with the real me.</p>

<em>Comment from a YouTube thread</em></p>

<p><strong>I'm not going off-grid</strong>. The most common reaction I get when I tell people I’m leaving social media is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think I know why you’re doing it. Bold decision, I admire you. I’d do it too if I could.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think it’s a bold decision at all. On the contrary. Another common motif is that I’m supposedly going to become a hermit. To put things in context: in 2020, 3.96 billion people — 51% of the entire world population — are using social media (source: <a href="https://wearesocial.com/sg/blog/2020/07/more-than-half-of-the-people-on-earth-now-use-social-media">We Are Social</a>). For the very first time, there are more people using these tools than do not. This doesn’t automatically mean that the whole 51% are <em>active</em> on social media and the spike is most likely another side effect of COVID-19 and lockdowns. The point is: you can't attach a <em>hermit</em> label to almost 4 billion people. Especially when <a href="/contact/">I can easily be found</a> in different ways.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I’ll probably post a follow-up in a year or so. Although unlikely, I might end up changing my mind. For now, I’ve been experiencing several positive effects already. I currently am:</p>

<ul class="list-hr">
  <li>Reading multiple books at the same time.</li>
  <li>Chewing through my ‘read later’ list like I haven’t done in years.</li>
  <li>Feeling less burdened and way less angry.</li>
  <li>Having deeper conversations with a group of people larger than my usual circle.</li>
  <li>Extremely productive.</li>
</ul>
