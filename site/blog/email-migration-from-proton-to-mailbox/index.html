	<p>The reason for embarking on such a task has a very short answer. When I chose Proton years ago, I wasn’t bothered by the feeling of being trapped in a walled garden. Now I am.</p>

<p>With Proton I’m not allowed to use any system program such as Calendar and Contacts. Having to go through their own proprietary applications, makes a proper sync quite cumbersome. External email clients are barely supported — on desktop only — and require a daemon running in the background at all times.</p>

<p>A nice plus of the migration is that I'm going to save around €20 per year: money that can be redirected to other digital venues. Mailbox.org is hosted in the EU (Germany) on <a href="https://mailbox.org/en/company#our-responsibility">green servers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Note</strong>: the following was done on macOS 10.14.</p></aside>

<p>After getting the gist of how the various services and settings work in my new Mailbox account, I've added €3 to become a paying customer. I like this formula, as it leaves me free to fully experiment for a while without committing to an annual payment yet.</p>

<p>I got 50 aliases, including for my custom domains. Setting them up was as easy as adding a bunch of DNS values (TXT and MX) after authenticating the domains with Mailbox. I also improved the spam reputation by <a href="https://kb.mailbox.org/en/private/custom-domains/spf-dkim-and-dmarc-how-to-improve-spam-reputation-and-avoid-bounces">setting up SPF, DKIM and DMARC</a>.</p>

<p>Mailbox gave me automatic configuration profiles for macOS' Mail, Calendar and Contacts applications. While preferring a manual setup for IMAP and SMTP on Mail.app, I've chosen the easy and fast procedure for calDAV and cardDAV.</p>

<p>Next, I've exported a full backup of contacts and calendars from Proton. Importing them back on Mailbox was straightforward: all I've used was the import functionality from the default Apple applications. To move the entirety of my 25-thousand emails I relied on a manual migration: selecting large chunks of messages at a time (around 1k), using Mail.app: no issue whatsoever.</p>

<p>All in all, despite dreading the idea of wasting time and energy, it was a surprisingly quick job. With zero experience with Mailbox.org, it took no more than a couple hours from start to finish.</p>

<h2 id="side-effects">Side effects</h2>

<p>Migrating a whole email system isn't limited to the above. There's also the most frustrating consequence of a bad choice: having a gigantic number of accounts registered with an email address tied to Proton. Could be Gmail or a free Outlook or iCloud or whatever: anything that ties me to a system that's closed in itself and completely outside my control is awfully shortsighted.</p>

<p>I had to alter all my accounts, swapping an address that I'm going to lose soon with one from a personal domain. My domain is under my full control: I can move the hosting, change DNS, nameservers, whatever — <em>it stays with me</em>, while everything else can disappear. Google, Microsoft, Apple could close my account on a whim, good luck trying to get them back.</p>

<p>In the end, changing email address for a multitude of online accounts took longer than the entire migration. Especially with government services.</p>

<h2 id="mobile">Mobile</h2>

<p>This was the surprise I enjoyed the most. Being on Android, I feared the idea of having to look for good apps that can support cardDAV and calDAV natively. While reading Mailbox FAQs, I stumbled on an article where they suggested a <abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> app available on F-Droid called <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/">DAVx<sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

<p>It was just a matter of adding the single Mailbox account in the app and activate calDAV and cardDAV. Afterwards, the integrated Contacts and Calendar apps by Google would simply sync to it. I feel obliged to remark that I <em>don't have a Google account</em> set up with my Android phone, and yet they work seamlessly with Mailbox through DAVx<sup>5</sup> sync.</p>

<p>Email on Android was as easy as setting up a single account on <a href="https://k9mail.app/">K-9</a> and adding all the identities connected to my domains.</p>
