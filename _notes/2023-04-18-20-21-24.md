I actually have little to no problem about mixing and mastering my own music, even though I quoted that personal example :) I fully understand your wish to have a keen spirit working on your material. As a professional mixer, I often step out of my comfort zone to work on genres that are alien to me, however, I'm never sure if I'm the right person for a certain job.

We could start a discussion on Mastodon over the next few days, and see if this idea could put down some roots :)
