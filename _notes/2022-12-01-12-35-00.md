I love how I can visit your website almost daily and expect nice design changes. In my experience, granular Indieweb content isn't that exciting. After trying (unsuccessfully) to blindly apply the Indieweb principles like a dogma, I ended up on Mastodon to open myself and have a diverse kind of group of people with whom I could interact. Maybe it was just a wrong approach, but I'm sure I disliked the feeling of an extremely tight tech bubble where people speak one language, of which I couldn't fully understand the whole scope.

I've just finished implementing a dark mode and I'm quite happy with it. I've done it for myself first and foremost (I was blinded by the white background at night), but also as a user I like when websites gracefully turn the lights off after a certain time of the day.

Finally, I loved your super brutalist design last week. I think you can do whatever you want, but I'll always like your website and that's because of the content.
