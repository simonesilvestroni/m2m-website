[@wouter](https://brainbaking.com/notes/2022/05/11h17m44s06/){: .u-in-reply-to } I have now updated my [original post]({{ site.url }}/blog/automation-for-my-blog-publishing-workflow/) and printed the code from the shell script in the **new post** automation. The code was visible in the script screenshot only. You can now see I have both <kbd>date</kbd> and <kbd>last_modified_at</kbd> in my Front Matter, formatted as `%-d %B %Y %T`.

What you're saying in your last paragraph is exactly how I used to do new posts before, by using just Sublime Text and its Jekyll package, which features a way to set up templates and fill as much meta as I can/want. I used to manually add tags and categories. I have to say, after a week with the new automation, I'm totally okay with it. I didn't mind the way I did things before, but I'm happy about going from clicking an icon to having my editor ready in a few seconds.
