@wouter I do have a graceful degradation in my search page as well, though my decision was to show both the JS-based instant search and the DDG-driven static functionality, regardless of whether the person has JS enabled or not. To be honest, I'm wondering why providing the JS-based one when the DuckDuckGo search works well anyway. I also have a "More" section that I mostly use to keep the main navigation easier on mobile. I know I'm technically "hiding" content, but it's a compromise that works with me (for now). Emojis are used in the 'more' page to group the additional pages under some kind of 'topic' â€” though maybe it's a bit obscure...
