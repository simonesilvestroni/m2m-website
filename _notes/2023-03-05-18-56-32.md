@zinzy thanks for your take, I always enjoy your point of views. I currently have close to zero relationships with GenZ-ers (is that a word?) both offline and online, however I can imagine your feelings on this! For a while recently I've been exposed to boomers and seeing how they approach things surprised me, a lot. How differently Gen-Xers grew up: it's like we've been living on two planets that aren't even in the same solar system.
