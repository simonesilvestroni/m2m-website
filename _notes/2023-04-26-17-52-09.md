I've been following your site via RSS for a while now, but I'm compelled to comment on this post today because it's been a whole week of discovering new brilliant personal websites. So many amazing people are out there, posting interesting essays, beautiful photos and more. I used to regret the time I wasted on mainstream social media: now I'm just moving on. I first joined the internet in 1995, so to me this is a comeback. It doesn't really feel new, but the excitement is similar to my BBS, USENET newsgroups and IRC days -- which is cool.
