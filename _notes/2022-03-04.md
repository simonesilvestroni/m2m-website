description: 'Quote from Nolan Lawson about the good, the bad and the mixed bag of being outside Twitter for the last five years.'
excerpt: '<blockquote><p>Twitter (like all social media) is an outrage machine, designed to goose engagement using whatever means the algorithm finds through blind optimization. [...] Social media engagement thrives when it finds a wedge to drive between two parts of a community, where it can cause incendiary content to cross-pollinate from one camp to another, creating an endless cycle of irritation, condemnation, dunking, and flaming.</p><cite>Nolan Lawson</cite></blockquote>'
