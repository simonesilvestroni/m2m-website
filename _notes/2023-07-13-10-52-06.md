Tracy, thank you so much for mentioning my post about human connection. It's funny how this morning I read your post through IndieWeb News' RSS feed â€” then I received a webmention as well :) I'm replying via webmention myself, though I suppose you'll get this as a comment in WordPress. We have a very similar approach towards the web, I've just followed your micro.blog via Mastodon for now, cheers!
