<mark>{{ page.replytouser }}</mark> thanks for the debug! Since I released this version of the website I've must have changed the layout a billion times and didn't test the JS behavior properly... 

I'm not fussed about DuckDuckGo, all the results lead to my website anyway. I've now added the search link to the footer and in the first lead paragraph of the blog page :)

The 'most popular' gets an update every 6 months â€” roughly.

Yes, the missing 'Notes' page is on purpose.
