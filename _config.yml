  m2m_pitch: 'I’m a digital polymath between creativity and logic'
  m2m_intro: '<p class="fs-4">Hey, Simone Silvestroni here. While graduating as a musician, I started working in the publishing industry during the 1990s. Later, I learned web design as its digital evolution. Expert in front-end development, some back-end, UI design, custom WordPress systems, accessibility and sustainability.</p><p class="m2m-text-indent-0 fs-4">Passionate about storytelling, in 2000 I landed a game audio designer role where I created adaptive soundtracks and original sound effects. I produce and edit from start to finish. I’m also a bass player, a composer and a field recordist. <a class="ps-2" href="/about/"><strong>Read more ↗︎</strong></a></p>'
